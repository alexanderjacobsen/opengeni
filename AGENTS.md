# Agent / automation notes (OpenGeni)

This repository is a clean TypeScript/Bun stack. The public API is session-based.

> **Start here for orientation: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).** It is the canonical whole-system map — what OpenGeni is, the load-bearing invariants, the full repo layout, per-component deep-dives, and a *"if you're changing X, read Y first"* decision table. Read it before navigating an unfamiliar area, and **keep it current**: if your change adds/removes/renames an app, package, or sandbox backend; alters an architectural invariant, the data-flow, or the session/turn lifecycle; or changes which file is canonical for a change area — update `docs/architecture.md` in the *same* change. A stale map is a bug. (This file, AGENTS.md, owns *how to run and operate* the stack; architecture.md owns *how the system is shaped*.)

When the user says **"start the dev server"**, **"spin it up"**, or **"run the full stack"**, they mean the steps under **Full local stack**.

## Full Local Stack

The stack means everything needed to run the Hono API, React web app, Temporal worker, Postgres event store, Core NATS realtime bus, Temporal service, and configured OpenAI Agents SDK sandbox backend.

1. Start the full local stack:

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

   This installs dependencies, starts the Docker infrastructure, runs migrations, builds the local sandbox image, and starts API, worker, and web processes.

Manual equivalent:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. Start infrastructure:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d postgres nats temporal minio minio-init
   bun run db:migrate
   ```

3. Build the local sandbox image when using Docker sandbox:

   ```bash
   docker build -f docker/sandbox.Dockerfile -t opengeni-sandbox:local .
   ```

4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure at least:

   - `OPENGENI_DATABASE_URL`
   - `OPENGENI_NATS_URL`
   - `OPENGENI_TEMPORAL_HOST`
   - `OPENGENI_STARTUP_DEPENDENCY_RETRY_*` when dependencies need longer startup windows
   - OpenAI or Azure OpenAI credentials
   - `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_BACKEND` (see Sandbox Notes for the full backend list; `docker` is the default for local dev)
   - sandbox preparation profiles / env allowlist when needed

5. Start long-running processes in separate terminals:

   ```bash
   bun run dev:api
   bun run dev:worker
   bun run dev:web
   ```

Default URLs:

- API: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- API health: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz`
- Web: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- NATS monitor: `http://127.0.0.1:8222`
- Temporal gRPC: `127.0.0.1:7233`

`bun run dev` may auto-select alternate Docker Compose host ports when defaults are already in use; it wires those selected ports into the API and worker variable set for that run.

MinIO is the local S3-compatible object storage default for Docker Compose and optional self-contained Kubernetes smoke tests. Production deployments should use provider-native storage instead of deploying MinIO manually: `azure-blob` for Azure Blob, `aws-s3` for AWS S3, and `gcs` for Google Cloud Storage.

## Architecture Notes

For a map of every app, package, and how the parts fit together, start at [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) and follow its links to the focused topic docs.

- Public clients talk only to the API.
- Domain/access/billing helpers now live in `@opengeni/core` under `packages/core/src`; `apps/api` routes are HTTP adapters over them.
- Browser streaming uses `GET /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/sessions/:id/events/stream` with SSE.
- Session goals support `GET`, `PATCH(status paused|active)`, and idempotent `DELETE` clear on `/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/sessions/:id/goal`; clearing removes the goal row and emits `goal.cleared`.
- Core NATS is the realtime bus between producers and API instances.
- Postgres is the durable event store and replay source.
- Temporal is orchestration only. Token streams do not go through workflow history.
- OpenAI Agents SDK execution happens inside non-retryable worker activities.
- Agent activities are side-effectful. Do not add automatic Temporal retries around full agent turns unless each model/tool/sandbox boundary has been made idempotent.

## Run Lifecycle (read `docs/run-lifecycle.md` before changing the session workflow, the agent turn activity, or memory)

Three principles here are load-bearing and easy to break by accident:

- **No run-length limits, by design.** OpenGeni runs agents that legitimately work for days. Run length is bounded by symptoms (no-progress detection, budget exhaustion), never by counts or clocks. Do not add or lower caps on model calls per turn, continuation count, or activity timeout as a way to "be safe" — fix the pathology instead. See `docs/run-lifecycle.md` and `docs/goals.md`.
- **Three memory stores, three jobs.** `session_history_items` is conversation truth fed to the model (default read path). `agent_run_states` is the serialized RunState blob, used *only* to resume a turn paused for a human approval — never as conversation memory. `session_events` is the redacted, lossy human/audit timeline and must never be fed back to the model. Sandbox recovery state is separate again in `sandbox_session_envelopes`. Workspace knowledge memory (`knowledge_memories`, human-reviewed: agents search approved records and propose via the docs MCP tools) is retrieval context, never conversation memory.
- **Goals drive long runs.** An active goal turns "stop" into an explicit act; the continuation loop is replay-safe and lives in the session workflow. See `docs/goals.md`.
- **Synthesized follow-up turns preserve the effective model policy.** Goal continuations and child-completion parent wakes inherit model + reasoning from the newest turn that durably emitted `turn.started`, falling back to the session default only when no turn has actually run. A claimed turn rejected during admission must not silently switch the next turn's provider or billing owner.
- **Context overflow recovery is explicit and bounded.** Provider context-window overflows are classified inside `runAgentTurn`, force client compaction through the rendered-transcript summarizer + hard-trim retry + deterministic fallback ladder, then retry only after an actual compacted write when no model/tool progress was persisted. If progress was persisted, the turn auto-continues via a compaction resume notice when possible, otherwise publishes a compacted recovery message and idles the session for the next user message. `compacted:false` is never a retry ticket. This is not a Temporal retry and must not loop.
- **Sandbox warming is bounded and tracked.** A provider instance id must be persisted on the warming lease immediately after create returns, before readiness/setup. A turn waiting on another worker's warming lease is bounded by `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_WARMING_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 600000) and fails clearly on backend capacity/create timeout instead of heartbeating forever.
- **Worker deaths are survivable, but never via blind retries.** A graceful shutdown (SIGTERM) preempts the in-flight turn: checkpoint, requeue, `preempted` activity result, re-dispatch on a healthy worker via a `turn.preempted` resume notice. An ungraceful death (heartbeat-timeout activity failure) re-dispatches the turn from dual-written conversation truth via `requeueTurnAfterWorkerDeath`, bounded by a per-turn redispatch counter (3) before the session fails for real. Failed sessions are revivable: a new user message transitions failed → queued and restarts the workflow; only cancelled is terminal. Do not replace any of this with automatic Temporal retries of agent turns. See `docs/run-lifecycle.md`.

The agent turn activity is `runAgentTurn`, also registered under the legacy alias `runAgentSegment` for in-flight workflow histories — schedule `runAgentTurn` in new code.

## Keeping these notes current

If a change alters architecture, terminology, the run lifecycle, the memory model, or a "do not" guardrail above, update this file, [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md), and the relevant `docs/*.md` in the same change. In particular, structural changes (an app/package/sandbox backend added, removed, or renamed; a moved responsibility; a changed invariant, data-flow, or canonical source) belong in `docs/architecture.md` — see its "Keeping this current" section. An out-of-date AGENTS.md or doc is a bug, not a nicety.

## Keeping docs true

Use [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) as the docs map. When you move or rename files or packages, run `bun run check:docs-refs` and fix every current-tier reference it reports. A new package needs a package README plus the [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) package table. A new embed surface or port belongs in [`docs/embedding.md`](docs/embedding.md). A new process or command belongs in its canonical home from the docs map; link to that home instead of restating volatile details.

## Sandbox Notes

Sandbox execution is pluggable. `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_BACKEND` selects one of the backends defined by the `SandboxBackend` enum in `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` (the canonical list): `docker`, `modal`, `local`, `none`, `daytona`, `runloop`, `e2b`, `blaxel`, `cloudflare`, `vercel`, and `selfhosted`. `docker` is the default and the usual local-dev choice; `modal` and the other cloud backends are provisioned, swappable boxes. When you change the set of backends, update the enum first and treat it as the source of truth — this file and the README follow it.

The Docker sandbox image includes Terraform, Checkov, Azure CLI, GitHub CLI, git, jq, curl, and base shell utilities. Managed sandboxes also provision git-provider CLI auth wrappers for `gh`, `glab`, and `az`; the wrappers read current provider token files at invocation time and pass through cleanly when a token file is absent. Bundled Terraform/checkov skills live under `packages/runtime/src/bundled_hashicorp_terraform_skills` and are mounted into the sandbox under `.agents/`.

### Bring-your-own-compute — the Connected Machine (`selfhosted`)

A **Connected Machine** (the `selfhosted` backend) is a user's own always-on machine — a **first-class, co-equal PRIMARY compute target**, not merely a swappable sandbox. When a turn's *effective* backend is a machine, the agent runs on it **directly**; there is no provisioned box behind it. Use "Connected Machine" in product-facing prose and reserve "selfhosted" for the enum value / internal plumbing. Key invariants — do not break them:

- **Machine-primary, not a phantom box.** A machine-targeted turn establishes the `SelfhostedSession` **directly** (`establishSelfhostedTurnSession` in `apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn.ts`, the `machinePrimary` branch) and leases the group as `selfhosted` — it does **not** call `resumeBoxForTurn`, so **no Modal/cloud box is created, leased, or billed** for that turn. Warm-seconds meter off the effective backend (`selfhosted` = 0 rate), never the session's home backend.
- **No OpenGeni credential crosses to the machine; it uses its own git auth.** The env mint skips platform git-provider tokens for a `selfhosted`-effective turn (`sandboxEnvironmentForRun({ skipGitHubToken })` in `apps/worker/src/activities/environment.ts`), and selfhosted `exec` puts `env: {}` on the wire — structurally the platform token never reaches the machine. The machine authenticates git with its **own** credentials.
- **Repos are never cloned onto a machine.** `repositoryUsesSandboxClone` (`packages/runtime/src/index.ts`) returns `false` for a `selfhosted` effective backend (the clone-guard) — the machine already owns its filesystem, so a platform `git clone` must never land on the user's real disk.
- **Per-session working directory, not a fixed `/workspace`.** A machine runs under `sessions.working_dir` (migration 0027); `toMachinePath` (`packages/runtime/src/sandbox/selfhosted/session.ts`) re-anchors the virtual `/workspace` frame onto the chosen host path (default = the agent's launch `workspace_root`). The "`/workspace` for every run" assumption holds only for provisioned boxes.
- **Targeting a machine at create time.** `CreateSessionRequest.targetSandboxId` (+ optional `workingDir`) selects the machine for a new session; the active-sandbox pointer is seeded at creation so the **first** turn routes there (race-free). `workingDir` without `targetSandboxId` is a **422**, and an invalid/unowned/offline target **422s** rather than silently falling back to the default box (`packages/core/src/domain/sessions.ts`).
- **Never cold-create or kill a user's machine.** An offline self-hosted agent is *not* a `NotFound`; the lease never provisions a rival box, and the reaper drains a self-hosted box to cold but never provider-stops it. The capability descriptor is `persistable: false` (no disk snapshot) and the box is never idle-reaped.
- **Control surface is NATS, not a provider API.** Exec/fs/git run over a `ControlRpc` request/reply seam addressed by `agent.<ws>.<id>.rpc`, encoded via `@opengeni/agent-proto` (the protobuf wire IDL codegen'd to both Rust and TS so the control plane and agent never drift). `negotiateCapabilities` surfaces online/offline/reconnecting/consent_required/display_unavailable states.
- **Gated off by default.** The whole feature is behind `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_SELFHOSTED_ENABLED` (default OFF). When off, enrollment routes 404 and the backend is inert — boot is unaffected. Related config: the `OPENGENI_SELFHOSTED_NATS_*`, `OPENGENI_SELFHOSTED_RELAY_*`, and `OPENGENI_SELFHOSTED_RELAY_TOKEN_SECRET` env vars wire the control plane, callout account, and relay tier.
- **Machine UI is opt-in.** Connected-machine React components (machines dashboard, enrollment, status pills, metrics) live on the `@opengeni/react/machines` subpath, so the `@opengeni/react` root import stays a clean sandbox-only default; the root re-exports them deprecated for back-compat (#144).
- Sandbox/enrollment/metrics tables and the session `active_sandbox_id`/`active_epoch` pointer (migration 0024) make sandboxes swappable within a session. Design dossier lives under `docs/design/sandbox-surfacing/`.

Enabled capability packs can scope the runtime per workspace: a registered pack manifest may declare `skills` (delivered into the same `.agents/` skill index as the bundled skills) and a `sandboxImage` that replaces the global `OPENGENI_DOCKER_IMAGE`/`OPENGENI_MODAL_IMAGE_REF` for that workspace's sessions. At most one enabled pack per workspace may declare an image — no image composition. See `docs/packs.md`.

When the `azure` sandbox preparation profile is enabled and ARM/AZURE service-principal variables are allowed into the sandbox, the worker pre-authenticates normal Azure CLI inside the sandbox with `az login --service-principal` before the agent starts. There is no custom `opengeni-azure-login` helper.

Sandbox preparation is controlled by:

- `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_PREPARATION_PROFILES=none`, `azure`, `github`, or comma-separated profile names
- `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_ENV_ALLOWLIST=...` for extra explicit host env vars

Explicit `OPENGENI_GIT_*` settings can set sandbox git author/committer identity. Ambient host `GIT_AUTHOR_*` and `GIT_COMMITTER_*` variables only pass through when the `github` preparation profile or env allowlist permits them.

Do not expect model provider credentials to automatically appear in the sandbox unless explicitly allowed.

The API and sandbox file-resource object-storage boundary supports `s3-compatible`, `azure-blob`, `aws-s3`, and `gcs`. Azure Blob-backed Docker/local sandboxes use native Azure Blob manifest mounts. Modal Azure Blob, AWS S3, and GCS file resources use short-lived signed download materialization.

## Verification

Unit tests and typechecks do not require Temporal, NATS, Postgres, a sandbox backend, or live model credentials:

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun test
```

End-to-end agent runs require the full stack plus valid model and sandbox credentials.

## Deployment Work Notes

When working on production deployment, Azure/AWS/GCP deployment, Helm, Terraform, conformance checks, preview variable-sets, observability, or cloud-provider-agnostic infrastructure, treat the source as authoritative: deployment contracts in `packages/deployment`, the Helm chart under `deploy/helm/opengeni`, Terraform roots under `deploy/terraform`, stack wrappers under `deploy/stacks`, and operator docs in `docs/deployment.md`.

Keep provider resource inventories, cleanup notes, cloud account identifiers, private endpoints, generated credentials, kubeconfigs, Terraform state, plans, local tfvars, service-account keys, and access keys in private operator-controlled storage outside the repository.

Use official upstream charts/operators or managed services for production platform services. OpenGeni's chart should own OpenGeni API, web, worker, migrations, and integration resources. Built-in Postgres, Temporal, NATS, and MinIO templates are disposable conformance fixtures for local, CI, and smoke verification only; do not present them as lightweight production alternatives.
