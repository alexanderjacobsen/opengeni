//! Full-jitter exponential backoff for the resiliency supervisor.
//!
//! Reconnect-storm TLS-handshake CPU is the named #1 outage cause (dossier
//! §10.6/§19), so backoff is a **day-1, first-class** concern, not an
//! afterthought. We use the "full jitter" strategy from the canonical AWS
//! Architecture Blog analysis: each delay is a uniform random draw in
//! `[0, min(cap, base * 2^attempt)]`. Full jitter both spreads a thundering herd
//! across the whole window *and* keeps the expected delay low, beating
//! "equal jitter" and plain capped-exponential for de-correlating reconnects.
//!
//! ## Fast phase (recover a rolling-deploy blip in seconds, not minutes)
//!
//! The control-plane connection, its RPC responder subscription, AND the ~5s
//! liveness heartbeat all ride ONE NATS connection (see `supervisor.rs`). When a
//! control-plane rolling deploy briefly drops that connection, everything the
//! control plane sees of the machine — `last_seen_at` and the attach-gate ping —
//! goes dark together and only returns once this backoff lets the agent re-dial.
//! With a pure `1s→60s` exponential, a ~2-minute deploy window pushes the ceiling
//! to the 60s cap, so recovery lags the deploy by up to a full cap window (and
//! compounds on any failed attempt) — observed as multi-minute "machine offline;
//! cannot attach" outages after every deploy. So [`Backoff::standard`] runs a
//! FAST PHASE first: the initial `fast_attempts` attempts draw within a small
//! `fast_ceiling` (≈30s of ~1.5s-median retries) to catch a returning control
//! plane within a few seconds, THEN falls back to the exponential up to `cap`
//! (now 10s, not 60s) so a genuinely PROLONGED outage still de-correlates the
//! fleet reconnect (the #1-outage-cause storm protection is retained, just bounded
//! to a tighter cap). Full jitter spreads the herd across every window.
//!
//! The struct is deliberately decoupled from any clock or RNG source it cannot be
//! unit-tested against: [`Backoff::ceiling`] is the pure, exactly-checkable bound
//! and [`Backoff::next_delay`] draws within it. The supervisor sleeps for the
//! returned [`Duration`]; on a successful connect it calls [`Backoff::reset`].
