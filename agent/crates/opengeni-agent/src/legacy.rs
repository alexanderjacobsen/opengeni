//! Legacy-op adapters: the monolithic request/reply ops served OVER the op
//! engine (ENGINE-INTEGRATION.md §Supervisor rework).
//!
//! The wire shape is unchanged forever (compatibility contract): one
//! `ControlRequest{exec}` in, one assembled `ControlResponse` out. Underneath,
//! the command now runs as an engine job — same registry (duplicate request
//! ids attach to the stashed reply instead of re-running), same containment,
//! same retention/credit plumbing — with a BUFFERING consumer in place of a
//! remote one: the emit hook assembles the reply and self-acks cumulatively so
//! retention stays trimmed behind the stream.
//!
//! Reply-size posture (LIMITS-DOCTRINE): outputs up to the derived
//! reply-assembly breaker are buffered in full and the existing negotiated-
//! max-payload seam in the supervisor converts an oversized reply into the
//! same typed `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` as today. Beyond the breaker the op KEEPS
//! RUNNING to completion (side effects are the caller's; killing mid-run would
//! change legacy semantics) — bytes are counted, not stored, and the reply is
//! the typed oversize error naming the breaker.
