// apps/api/src/sandbox/viewer.ts — the API-DIRECT viewer-holder lifecycle (P1.4).
//
// A viewer (a human watching a session's box) acquires a `viewer` holder on the
// GROUP lease so the box stays warm WHILE WATCHED — liveness = turn OR viewer
// (the §C group-refcount win). All IN-PROCESS: the API runs the cold->warming
// CAS as a Postgres txn it owns, resumes the box BY ID via the leaf
// (@opengeni/runtime/sandbox), and never signals Temporal or a worker.
//
//   attach  -> acquireLease(kind:'viewer') under FOR UPDATE + cold->warming CAS.
//              spawner role  -> establish the box in-process + commitWarmingToWarm.
//              attached/rearmed -> the holder alone keeps the box warm.
//              fenced -> release + surface a 409 (a newer epoch re-established it).
//   heartbeat -> heartbeatLeaseHolder (epoch-fenced) refreshes the holder TTL.
//   detach  -> releaseLeaseHolder (idempotent); the reaper (P1.3) stop()s the
//              box at refcount 0 past the drain grace.
//
// The desktop pixel tunnel-URL mint + the un-redacted acknowledgment + the
// scoped token are P3/P4. Here we surface only the holder lifecycle + the
// lease's recorded data_plane_url (null until P4 mints it).
