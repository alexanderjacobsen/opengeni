/**
 * Deliver exactly one completion wake to a spawned worker's parent (manager)
 * session when the worker reaches a terminal-for-now state. No-op for a
 * parentless session (direct API create / scheduled run). Idempotent per
 * terminal episode: the idempotency key is the child's current lastSequence,
 * which advances every time the child does work, so a retry of the same
 * terminal transition (activity retry, the workflow's idle re-check, the
 * runAgentTurn-failed path overlapping a workflow-level wake) is deduped while
 * a genuinely new idle-after-work episode notifies again. The parent's queued
 * turn is delivered by the DB wake; signalling the parent's workflow
 * (signalWithStart) ensures a parent whose workflow already completed gets a
 * fresh run to claim it. Failures here never fail the child: the wake is a
 * best-effort nudge layered on durable DB state.
 *
 * Lives in its own module so both the session-state terminal activities
 * (markSessionIdle / failSession) and runAgentTurn's in-turn failure path can
 * call it without a circular import between those two activity modules.
