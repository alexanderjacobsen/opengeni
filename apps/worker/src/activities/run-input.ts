 *
 *  - `reasoning`  → DROPPED WHOLE (id + blob filtered out of the history). The

 *    so blanking only the blob is not enough — the whole item must go.
 *  - `compaction` → kept, with only its account-bound `encrypted_content` blob

 *  - everything else (messages, tool calls, tool outputs) → kept verbatim by
