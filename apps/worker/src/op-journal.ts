// The Temporal adaptation of the op-stream durable-resume journal
// (`OpStreamJournal`, @opengeni/runtime): the runtime leaf stays
// Temporal-free; this is where its two seams bind to the activity.
//
// * `attachGeneration` — the consumer generation the runner fences zombie
//   consumers by. `Info.attempt` CANNOT serve here: `runAgentTurn` runs with
//   `maximumAttempts: 1`, so worker death is healed by the WORKFLOW
//   redispatching a NEW activity whose attempt is 1 again. The activity's
//   `currentAttemptScheduledTimestampMs` is Temporal-server-assigned and
//   strictly larger for a later dispatch (death detection is bounded below by
//   the 2-minute heartbeat timeout, far above ms resolution), so it is a
//   monotonic generation with zero workflow plumbing. Intra-activity
//   re-attaches (blip/gap heals) reuse it — the runner's equal-generation
//   replay path.
//
// * `persistSettled` — the durable-before-wire-ack ordering hook: fold the
//   settled op's frontier into the activity's shared heartbeat details and
//   flush a heartbeat BEFORE the client publishes the final ack. The shared
//   `details` object is the SAME one every other heartbeat site spreads, so a
//   later phase heartbeat re-carries the roster instead of clobbering it.
