 * events, and the server force-terminates a run at its hard history limit
 * (~51,200 events / 50MB), killing the session. The server's
 * `continueAsNewSuggested` flag is the primary trigger (it fires well before
 * the hard cap), but a turn-counter backstop guarantees a continueAsNew even
 * if the suggestion never arrives (e.g. a deployment that never raises it).
 * Conservatively low relative to the event budget: a single turn schedules a
 * handful of history events, so a few thousand turns stays far under the cap
 * while keeping continueAsNew rare enough that it is not a per-turn cost.

 * rollout whose grace period expired) or a SCHEDULE_TO_START timeout (no
 * worker ever picked the task up). Detection uses the SDK's typed failure
 * classes, not message-string matching: the failure converter rehydrates
 * ActivityFailure/TimeoutFailure instances deterministically from recorded
 * history on replay, so instanceof + timeoutType checks are replay-safe and
 * do not depend on server-controlled message text. START_TO_CLOSE /
 * SCHEDULE_TO_CLOSE timeouts are deliberately excluded: with the 30-day
