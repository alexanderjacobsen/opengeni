# Capability Catalog

OpenGeni exposes a workspace-level capability catalog for packs, MCP servers, APIs, skills, and plugins.

The catalog merges:

- built-in OpenGeni packs, APIs, MCP servers, and bundled sandbox skills
- MCP servers configured through `OPENGENI_MCP_SERVERS`
- local catalog items added through the API or web app
- reviewed integrations.sh snapshot imports stored as global `source: "registry"` catalog rows
- public remote MCP servers discovered from the official MCP Registry

## Runtime Behavior

Remote MCP capabilities with a streamable HTTP endpoint are executable. Enabling a remote MCP first performs an MCP initialize/list-tools probe. If the probe succeeds, OpenGeni stores a `capability_installations` row and the API/worker merge that row into the runtime MCP server list for new sessions, follow-ups, and scheduled tasks. Sessions and scheduled tasks created without an explicit `tools` key are attached to every enabled capability MCP server by default; an explicit tools list (even an empty one) is taken verbatim. If the probe fails, the API returns `422` and the capability stays disabled, so a stale, down, or auth-only endpoint never breaks agent turns at runtime.

MCP tool refs are strict by default. A bare `{ "kind": "mcp", "id": "docs" }` must name a server configured for this deployment, and a runtime connect/list failure fails the turn. A client or pack can mark a ref `{ "kind": "mcp", "id": "context7", "optional": true }` to make it portable: if the deployment does not configure that server the ref is skipped during validation, and if the server is configured but unavailable at runtime it is skipped for that turn with a warning.

### Credential headers

MCP servers that require request headers (for example an `Authorization` bearer token) are enabled by passing the headers in the enable request:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/workspaces/$WORKSPACE_ID/capabilities/mcp%3Asecure-mcp/enable" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer <token>"}}'
```

The probe runs with those headers, and on success the values are stored encrypted (AES-256-GCM under `OPENGENI_ENVIRONMENTS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, like workspace variable set values) on the installation. At runtime the worker decrypts them and sends them only to that MCP server. The API never returns header values — installation responses expose the stored header names only. Re-enabling without a `headers` field reuses the stored credentials; passing `headers` replaces them.

Registry entries that declare required headers are tagged `requires-credentials` and cannot be enabled until the declared headers are supplied.

APIs, skills, and plugins are tracked in the same catalog and install table so operators can build a role-oriented workspace inventory. Built-in APIs and bundled skills are already available. Custom APIs, skills, and plugins need their own adapter or runtime implementation before tracking them changes agent execution.

Configured MCP endpoint URLs are visible in the catalog. Do not put tokens or other secrets in `OPENGENI_MCP_SERVERS` URLs.

## API

List the merged catalog:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/workspaces/$WORKSPACE_ID/capabilities"
```

Search the official MCP Registry for public remote MCP servers:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/workspaces/$WORKSPACE_ID/capabilities/discovery/mcp-registry?query=social&limit=20"
```

Add a public remote MCP server to the local catalog:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/workspaces/$WORKSPACE_ID/capabilities" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "id": "mcp:example-mcp",
    "kind": "mcp",
    "source": "manual",
    "name": "Example MCP",
    "endpointUrl": "https://example.com/mcp",
    "category": "marketing",
    "tags": ["social", "analytics"]
  }'
```

Enable it:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/workspaces/$WORKSPACE_ID/capabilities/mcp%3Aexample-mcp/enable" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"config":{},"metadata":{"enabledBy":"operator"}}'
```

If the MCP endpoint initializes successfully, the enabled MCP is returned by the workspace capability catalog and can be selected as a session tool in the web app. Configured MCP servers still come from `/v1/config/client`. If the probe fails, the API returns `422` and the capability remains disabled.

## Web Flow

Open the **Capabilities** view in the web app to:

- filter and search the local catalog
- enable role packs
- add and enable public MCP Registry results
- add manual MCP entries and track API/skill/plugin entries
- select enabled custom MCPs in the agent composer

The official MCP Registry is public metadata. Evaluate any server and its endpoint before enabling it in a workspace with sensitive data.

## integrations.sh Snapshot Imports

The integrations catalog import pipeline is offline and reviewable. It never
live-consumes integrations.sh at request time. The reviewed source of truth is
the committed snapshot at `data/catalog/integrations-snapshot.json`. Updating it
is a PR workflow: run `bun run catalog:refresh`, review the snapshot diff, then
merge. Operators import that committed snapshot with `bun run catalog:import
--snapshot data/catalog/integrations-snapshot.json` (or the same path inside the
application image). The importer writes global capability rows, records an
`import_batches` provenance row with MIT attribution, and upserts registry
entries by `(provider_domain, mcp_url)`.
Rows removed from a later snapshot are marked `stale`, not deleted, and are
excluded from default workspace catalog listings.

Imported logos are fetched during import, validated as images below 512KB, and
stored through OpenGeni object storage under `catalog-assets/...`; catalog rows
store only the self-hosted `logoAssetPath`, never the third-party logo URL. The
normalization pass strips raw control characters from string fields, collapses
duplicate `(domain, name)` clusters to the best deterministic row, skips
known-dead demo domains, and quarantines flagged suspicious URLs in the batch
details for manual review.
