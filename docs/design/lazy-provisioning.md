# Lazy Sandbox Provisioning

`OPENGENI_SANDBOX_LAZY_PROVISION=true` defers provisioned sandbox creation until the first sandbox-backed operation in a turn. It is effective only when `sandboxOwnershipEnabled` is also true; with either flag off, the owned-sandbox path remains eager.

The worker still computes the stable manifest environment at turn start. That same object feeds both `runtime.buildAgent(...)` and the eventual `resumeBoxForTurn(...)` call, so the SDK's provided-session manifest check sees the same environment before and after the box exists. Repository sessions get the stable git-auth pointer env eagerly (`OPENGENI_GIT_TOKEN_FILE`, `GIT_ASKPASS`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT`); only the run-scoped GitHub token value is minted later by the provisioner and passed to `runOwnedSandboxSetup(...)` as an off-manifest seed.

While unprovisioned, the turn injects a `RoutingSandboxSession` backed by a synthetic default backend:

- `kind: "unprovisioned"`
- `sandboxId: null`
- `session.state.manifest === agent.defaultManifest` by reference

That reference identity is the invariant. The OpenAI Agents SDK's `applyManifestToProvidedSession(...)` compares current and target manifests; when both point at `agent.defaultManifest`, the delta is empty, so the SDK does not throw or write a new manifest before the real box exists. On the first default-pointer sandbox op, the routing proxy calls the in-process provisioner and then switches its backend state to the real established session.

The provisioner is a memoized promise scoped to one turn. Parallel tool calls share the same establish attempt. It runs:

1. worker-shutdown check
2. lazy run-scoped Git token mint, if repo resources need one
3. `resumeBoxForTurn(...)`
4. `runOwnedSandboxSetup(...)` against the un-proxied real session
5. lease heartbeat, warm-meter tick, and on-turn recording startup

It emits existing `sandbox.operation.started/completed/failed` events with `name: "sandbox.provision"` around the whole establish. Failures propagate to the awaiting sandbox operation; the SDK then surfaces them through its normal tool-error path.

Retries are deliberately narrow: provider create/capacity/timeout classes and `SandboxLeaseSupersededError` get two short retries inside the provisioner. `SandboxImageConflictError` is not retried because the operator action is to resolve the live image conflict. On final failure, all waiters reject and the memo resets so a later sandbox operation can try a fresh establish.

Turn cleanup is conditional. If the provisioner never ran, there is no lease, timer, recording, or box to release. If it ran or is still in flight, the activity waits briefly for it to settle, then uses the same release/snapshot/recording finalization path as eager ownership.

Machine-primary Connected Machine turns are not lazy. They still establish the `SelfhostedSession` directly at turn start, never create a phantom cloud box, and bill zero cloud warm-seconds.
