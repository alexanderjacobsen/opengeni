# ADR: Prompt-cache-aware codex request construction and account affinity

Status: accepted (records existing invariants + one confirmed regression class)
Scope: the codex-subscription model path (gpt-5.x driven through ChatGPT/Codex accounts).

## Context

OpenGeni drives gpt-5.x through ChatGPT/Codex subscription accounts over a **stateless
resend** path: every model call re-sends the full request (`store: false` on the OpenAI
platform, reasoning continuity via replayed `reasoning.encrypted_content`, no
`previous_response_id`). There is no server-side conversation state to lean on, so the
**only** thing that makes a 180k–240k-token request cheap instead of expensive is
**OpenAI automatic prompt caching**: an exact-prefix-hash match from the start of the
request. A cache hit is charged at the cached input rate and returns faster (lower TTFT);
a miss is charged at full input rate *and* burns that much harder against the account's
5-hour / weekly subscription rate-limit windows.

Because the mechanism is prefix-hash-only and invisible unless you measure it, it is
easy to silently destroy — one wrong byte in the wrong layer cold-starts an entire
history prefix on every call, and nothing errors. This ADR records the invariants every
future agent must preserve, the one regression class we have already hit, and the
verified baseline that says the mechanism is worth this discipline.

## Decision — the invariants

### 1. The cacheable prefix is `[instructions, tools, history-prefix]` and it is BYTE-sensitive

OpenAI hashes the request as an ordered prefix starting at byte 0: the `instructions`
block, then the `tools` block, then the `input` history items. Matching is exact-prefix:
the cache is used up to the **first byte that differs** from a previously-seen request,
and everything after that point is a miss. The minimum cacheable prefix is ~1024 tokens.

Consequences that are non-negotiable:

- The `tools` block precedes the history. **Any** change to a tool definition (a
  description, a schema, even key ordering) invalidates the entire history that follows
  it — not just the tool.
- The `instructions` block precedes everything. A change there invalidates the whole
  request.
- Serialization must be stable. `buildAgent(...)` runs **once per turn**; the request
  body key order is fixed (`model, instructions, input, include, tools, stream, store`).
  Do not introduce a code path that re-derives instructions or tools per model call.

### 2. Nothing dynamic may render into instructions or tool definitions — per-turn snapshots only

Everything in the `instructions` and `tools` layers must be a **snapshot taken once at
turn start** and held byte-identical for every model call in that turn. Specifically,
none of the following may appear in those two layers:

- Live/mutable state that fills or changes during the turn (a `Set`/`Map`/array populated
  by in-flight work, a counter, a "currently active X" pointer).
- Timestamps, dates, elapsed time, or "now".
- Unordered collections serialized without a stable sort (iteration/key order drift is
  byte drift).
- Per-call randomness (nonce, uuid, sampled value).

If a value legitimately must change within a turn, it belongs in the **append-only tail**
after the history (where earlier bytes stay stable), never in the instructions/tools
prefix. This is the same discipline Codex CLI uses: static compiled-in base instructions,
environment context appended via an append-only diff where unchanged turns emit nothing.

### 3. Caches are per-subscription-account; a switch is a cold prefix

Prompt caches are **not shared between organizations**, and each ChatGPT/Codex account is
a distinct org. Therefore:

- A different account = a **cold** prefix. Switching a session's account mid-life throws
  away its warm cache. On the codex fleet this was measured at ~26 percentage points of
  cache loss on the first call of a switched turn.
- `prompt_cache_key` is a **routing/affinity hint only** — it nudges requests with the
  same key toward the same backend to improve hit rates. It does **not** create
  cross-account sharing and cannot rescue a switch. We set it to the session id
  (`promptCacheKey = sessionId`), which is stable per session; keep it that way.
- Cache warmth is therefore an **account-affinity** property. Keeping a session on one
  account preserves its warm prefix; the full capacity/assignment design that exploits
  this lives in `docs/design/subscription-capacity-and-caching.md`.

### 4. Retention is short and some invalidation is legitimate — be schedule-aware

The Codex path cache expires after roughly **15 minutes idle** (OpenAI docs quote
5–10 min up to 1h; OpenAI staff quote ~15 min specifically for the Codex path). Two
kinds of invalidation are **expected, not bugs**, and must not be "fixed":

- **Long idle gaps.** An autonomous turn that idles > ~15 min between model calls
  legitimately cold-starts the next call. This is an OpenAI TTL, not a client defect.
- **Compaction.** Compaction deliberately rewrites the stable history prefix to shrink
  context. The next call after a compaction is *supposed* to re-warm from a new prefix.

Distinguish these scheduled invalidations from a *bug* (a warm, recent, same-account
request that still misses). Only the latter is a client problem.

### 5. Measurement is empirical — read `cached_tokens`, never assume

Cache behavior is not inferable from the code; it must be observed per call.
`usage-telemetry.ts` reads the cached count from the Responses API usage under the field
aliases `cached_tokens` / `cachedInputTokens` / `cached_input_tokens` and emits it on the
persisted `agent.model.usage` event (input tokens, cached tokens, provider, model,
sourceKey). The cached ratio for a call is `cached_tokens / input_tokens`, where
`input_tokens` is the total input (cached is a subset of it). Any claim about caching —
"this change helped", "the prefix is stable", "the account is warm" — must be backed by
that number, not by reading the request construction.

## The canonical regression: "mutable state rendered into the stable prefix"

**Pattern name: mutable state rendered into the stable prefix.** Correct data, placed in
the wrong layer (the byte-stable, cache-hashed prefix), at the wrong cadence (per model
call instead of per turn), silently cold-starts every request.

### The incident (tool_search)

`installCodexToolSearch` wraps `getAllTools`, so the `tool_search` tool **description is
re-rendered on every model call** from a **live by-reference `Set`** of connector
namespaces that fills *during the turn* as the `codex_apps` `tools/list` results resolve.
The description flips mid-turn from:

> "…Connected sources: none currently available."

to:

> "…You have access to tools from the following sources: - github - gmail - linear"

Because the `tools` block precedes the history in the prefix (invariant 1), the model
call *after* that flip misses the **entire history prefix**, not just the tool. Nothing
errors; the only symptom is a collapsed `cached_tokens`.

This was confirmed on the wire: a two-model-call capture showed the core client prefix
byte-stable (`instructions equal: true`, `tools equal: true`, shared input items
identical) **except** the `tool_search` description, which was `equal across calls:
false` once the connector `Set` filled between calls. So the core request construction is
clean; this one rewrap is the confirmed client-side breaker. Its blast radius is scoped
to connector-enabled turns at the discovery transition — real and fixable, but not the
whole story (steady-state within-turn non-warming has a separate, backend-leaning cause;
see the plan doc).

### The fix shape (and its trap)

Snapshot the `tool_search` description **once per turn** instead of reading the live
`Set` per call. But the snapshot has a capability trap: the connector `Set` fills lazily,
and the description is the model's *only* signal of which connectors exist (schemas are
deferred). Freezing an empty/partial snapshot at "first model call" would tell the model
"no connectors" for the whole turn even though the user connected some — a **functional
capability loss, worse than a cache miss**. The only safe form is: populate the connector
`Set` *before* the first model call (block on discovery), then freeze; on discovery
timeout/partial-failure, **fall back to today's per-call live render** and accept the
cache miss. Never freeze an empty or partial snapshot.

## Reviewer checklist — before anything renders into `instructions` or `tools`

Ask, for every value composed into those two layers:

1. **Live state?** Does it read a `Set`/`Map`/array/counter/"active pointer" that is
   populated or mutated *during* the turn? (The tool_search bug.)
2. **Time?** Does it include a timestamp, date, elapsed time, or "now"?
3. **Unordered serialization?** Does it serialize a `Set`/`Map`/object whose
   iteration/key order is not explicitly, stably sorted?
4. **Per-call randomness?** A nonce, uuid, or sampled value?
5. **Cadence?** Is it computed **once per turn** (like `buildAgent`), or re-derived per
   model call by some wrapper?
6. **If it must change within the turn**, is it in the append-only tail *after* the
   history, rather than in the instructions/tools prefix?

Any "yes" to 1–4, or "per model call" on 5, is a prefix breaker. Move it to a per-turn
snapshot or to the append-only tail, and verify with `cached_tokens` on a two-call turn.

## The verified baseline (reference table)

The mechanism is worth the discipline because a single account, using this exact
construction, caches almost perfectly. The bar below is recomputed from local Codex CLI
rollouts and is reproducible with the committed script.

### Codex CLI baseline — the bar (verified, reproducible)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Rollout files scanned | 2,130 (2,017 with measured calls) |
| Model calls measured | 1,586,180 |
| Σ input tokens | 228,313,685,685 |
| Σ cached input tokens | 219,153,436,672 |
| **Token-weighted cached ratio** | **96.0%** |
| Per-call cached ratio, median (p50) | 98.8% |
| Per-call distribution p10 / p50 / p90 | 88.2% / 98.8% / 99.7% |
| Long agentic sessions (≥10 calls, ≥200k input), per-session median | 93.2% |
| Calls below 50% cached (cold starts) | 2.53% |
| Sanity: calls with cached > input | 0 |

Method: per model call, Codex logs an `event_msg` with `payload.type == "token_count"`
whose `payload.info.last_token_usage` carries `{ input_tokens, cached_input_tokens }` for
that single call. Token-weighted ratio = `Σ cached_input_tokens / Σ input_tokens`. The
per-call median (98.8%) is *higher* than the token-weighted figure (96.0%) because the
minority of large cold-start calls (the 2.53% below 50%) carry disproportionate token
weight — the correct relationship, and the reason the token-weighted number is the
headline for cost.

`~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`).

### OpenGeni codex-subscription fleet — the gap (measured at audit time)

Measured from the persisted `agent.model.usage` events over a 4-day window on the codex
fleet (point-in-time; requires production data access to reproduce, so it is *not* in the
committed script):

| Metric | Value | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Token-weighted cached ratio | ~48% | vs the 96% bar on the same construction |
| Within-turn call 1 → call 2 warming (same account) | ~31% → ~31% | call 2 re-sends call 1's prefix seconds later and does not warm |
| Model variance (same client code) | ~46%–76% across models | strong signal of a backend/model component |
| Account-switch penalty (first call of a switched turn) | ~26pp lower | invariant 3, quantified |

The gap between 96% and ~48% is the subject of the north-star plan. The core client
construction is byte-stable (proven on the wire), so the loss splits between the narrow,
confirmed `tool_search` breaker above and a steady-state floor most consistent with an
OpenAI backend / per-account concurrency effect (a controlled low-load probe to nail the
latter was blocked at audit time). Treat the cache-regime win from load-spreading as a
**hypothesis to be proven by measurement**, not a certainty — see the plan.
