# Embedding OpenGeni

This guide is for a host application that embeds OpenGeni instead of running it only as the stock API + worker service. Embedding means binding host-owned concerns (identity, tenancy, billing admission, credentials, persistence, worker process, and event bus) into the same OpenGeni domain/runtime code the standalone stack uses.

The contract is simple: **all ports unset means standalone**. The defaults in `apps/api/src/index.ts`, `apps/worker/src/activities.ts`, and `packages/db/src/index.ts` preserve the normal local/self-hosted deployment behavior. An embedded host opts in by binding only the seams it owns.

## Consumption Shapes

**V1: mount the router.** Import `createApp(deps)` from `@opengeni/api-router/app` (`apps/api/src/app.ts`) and mount the returned Hono app under the host's route prefix. The dependency bag is `AppDependencies` from `@opengeni/core` (`packages/core/src/dependencies.ts`): `settings`, `db`, `bus`, and `workflowClient` are required; `documentIndexer`, `documentServices`, `observability`, `managedAuth`, `sandboxClient`, and `resumeBoxById` are optional host bindings. The routes remain `/v1/...` inside the mounted app. If the mount prefix makes the worker's loopback MCP URL wrong, set `OPENGENI_MCP_URL` / `settings.opengeniMcpUrl`; `firstPartyMcpBaseUrl` in `packages/config/src/index.ts` is the canonical rule.

**V2: call core directly.** Import from `@opengeni/core` and call domain helpers without HTTP. The main session surface is:

```ts
createSessionForRequest(deps, grant, workspaceId, rawPayload)
acceptSessionUserMessage(deps, grant, workspaceId, sessionId, input)
```

Both live in `packages/core/src/domain/sessions.ts` and expect `ApiRouteDeps` plus an `AccessGrant`. Scheduled-task validation/sync helpers live in `packages/core/src/domain/scheduled-tasks.ts`. V2 skips Hono parsing/routing, but it does not skip Postgres, EventBus, Temporal wakeups, or worker execution.

### Agent persona: two levers

A host that runs multiple agent personas has two composable, system-level instruction levers. Both ride the same authoritative instructions channel the agent obeys — neither is ever rendered as a user/timeline message — and they compose in a fixed order: **deployment default template → workspace persona → per-session instructions** (session-specific last), with the non-bypassable CORE (goal-loop ownership + variable set block) always substituted in.

- **Workspace `agentInstructions`** (`Workspace.agentInstructions`, set at workspace create/update) — the white-label persona for *every* session in a workspace. Use it for stable, tenant-wide branding/behavior. It may embed the `{{core}}` marker to place the non-bypassable CORE; if it omits the marker, CORE is appended.
- **Per-session `instructions`** (`CreateSessionRequest.instructions`) — an optional, per-*session* refinement layered after the workspace persona. Use it to deliver a **per-agent-type prompt** (reviewer vs. planner vs. fixer) when many personas share one workspace, without minting a workspace per persona. It is org-visible metadata (returned on the session record, exposed like `title`/`goal`), **never** a timeline event, so internal prompt content does not leak to shared-session readers and carries full system-level authority.

Prefer `instructions` over stuffing persona text into `initialMessage`: `initialMessage` renders as visible timeline content, has weaker instruction authority, and is readable by anyone with the session. Reach for workspace `agentInstructions` when the persona is the same for the whole tenant; reach for session `instructions` when it varies per session. Omitting `instructions` is byte-identical to today's composition. It is trimmed, non-empty, and capped at 32768 characters.

## Ports

### Identity Resolver Chain

Canonical source: `packages/core/src/access/index.ts`.

HTTP routes use `requireAccessContext(c, deps)` and `requireAccessGrant(c, deps, workspaceId, permission)`. The chain is selected by `settings.productAccessMode`:

- `local`: calls `bootstrapWorkspace` for the default local account/workspace.
- `configured`: accepts an `ogd_` delegated bearer when `settings.delegationSecret` is set; otherwise bootstraps a configured workspace using `x-opengeni-subject`.
- `managed`: tries a delegated bearer, then hashed API key, then `managedAuth.api.getSession(...)`.

There is no separate exported `IdentityResolver` type in this pass. A V1 host binds identity through `managedAuth`, delegation/API-key settings, and HTTP headers. A V2 host may resolve identity itself and pass an `AccessGrant` directly to core domain functions.

### Tenancy / Bootstrap Workspace

Canonical source: `bootstrapWorkspace` in `packages/db/src/index.ts`.

`bootstrapWorkspace(db, input)` receives external account/workspace identifiers, display names, a subject id/label, and optional permission arrays. It creates or updates the account, workspace, and membership rows, then returns an `AccessContext`.

The workspace remains the operational boundary. Route and core code must use the workspace id from the grant/path, not a resource id, as the access boundary.

### Entitlements / Admit Run

Canonical sources: `EntitlementsPort` in `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`, core `checkLimit`/`requireLimit` in `packages/core/src/billing/limits.ts`, worker-side `ensureRunAllowed` in `apps/worker/src/activities/agent-turn.ts`.

`EntitlementsPort` is:

```ts
type EntitlementsPort = {
  admitRun(input: {
    accountId: string;
    workspaceId: string;
    action: string;
    quantity: number;
  }): Promise<EntitlementDecision>;
};
```

When bound on the worker through `ActivityDependencies.entitlements`, `admitRun` replaces local credit-balance admission for managed/Stripe-funded non-Codex turns. When unset, OpenGeni uses its local ledger/static limits exactly as standalone. The port is admission-only; metering remains the idempotency-keyed usage writer. In this branch the core API admission path still calls `requireLimit`; do not document an API-side entitlements binding until source wires one.

### Connection Credentials

Canonical sources: `ConnectionCredentialsPort` in `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`, consumers in `apps/worker/src/activities/environment.ts`.

The port can bind either or both legs:

```ts
type ConnectionCredentialsPort = {
  gitCredentials?(input: GitCredentialsRequest): Promise<GitCredentials>;
  sandboxSecrets?(input: SandboxSecretsRequest): Promise<SandboxSecrets>;
};
```

`gitCredentials` is provider-aware and remains GitHub-backward-compatible:
GitHub repository resources still arrive as the legacy shape
`{ accountId, workspaceId, installationId, repositoryIds }`, with omitted
`provider` meaning `"github"`. Non-GitHub resources arrive with
`provider: "gitlab" | "azure_devops"` plus `repositoryRefs`. Provider-neutral
repository refs can carry `provider`, `repositoryId`, `installationId`,
`projectId`, and `connectionId`; `RepositoryResourceRef` accepts the same
optional fields while retaining the existing `githubInstallationId` and
`githubRepositoryId` aliases. The returned token plus scoped `workspaceId` is
checked by the FORK-7 workspace-echo assert before the worker injects anything.
A mismatch hard-fails before tenant B's credential can land in tenant A's run.

The worker never writes token values into the sandbox manifest or attach-time
environment delta. It passes current provider tokens to the runtime as
off-manifest seeds; the sandbox setup writes them to
`OPENGENI_GIT_CREDENTIALS_DIR/<provider>-token`, keeps
`OPENGENI_GIT_TOKEN_FILE` as the GitHub alias, and provisions `gh`, `glab`, and
`az` wrappers that read the current token file before each CLI invocation.
`sandboxSecrets` receives `{ accountId, workspaceId, variableSetId }` and returns
plaintext variable set values plus the scoped `workspaceId`, with the same echo
check.

Unset legs fall back independently to standalone self-mint/decrypt. This port does **not** supply the first-party MCP delegated token: `firstPartyMcpRequestInit` in `packages/runtime/src/index.ts` self-mints the `ogd_` bearer with `signDelegatedAccessToken(settings.delegationSecret, ...)`.

### Persistence

Canonical sources: `packages/db/src/index.ts`, `packages/db/src/migrate.ts`, `packages/db/src/provision-roles.ts`, and `dbSearchPath` in `packages/config/src/index.ts`.

Standalone uses `createDb(settings.databaseUrl)` and no search-path override. Embedded hosts can use:

- `runMigrations(adminConnection, targetSchema)` / `migrate(databaseUrl, schema)` to apply the SQL chain under a caller-selected schema.
- `provisionRoles(adminConnection, { targetSchema, rlsStrategy })` for app/Temporal role setup.
- `createDb(databaseUrl, { searchPath, rlsStrategy, userLookup, max })` for postgres-js handles.
- `registerDbBinding(db, { rlsStrategy, userLookup })` for an externally constructed Drizzle handle.

Dedicated-schema deployments use a search path shaped like `<schema>,opengeni_private,public`; `public` stays last so pgcrypto/pgvector symbols resolve. `rlsStrategy: "force"` is the standalone posture: OpenGeni connects as a non-owner role and FORCE RLS applies. `rlsStrategy: "scoped"` is the embedded owner-role posture: the host owns the isolation boundary, but OpenGeni still emits the `opengeni.account_id` / `opengeni.workspace_id` GUCs on scoped queries.

### Worker

Canonical source: `createOpenGeniWorker(options)` in `apps/worker/src/index.ts`.

The worker is always a separate durable process for real agent turns. A host runs it next to the app and passes `WorkerOptions`:

```ts
type WorkerOptions = {
  settings?: Settings;
  activities?: ReturnType<typeof createActivities>;
  activityDependencies?: ActivityDependencies;
};
```

`ActivityDependencies` can inject `settings`, `db`, `bus`, `runtime`, `objectStorage`, `documentServices`, `observability`, `wakeSessionWorkflow`, `entitlements`, and `connectionCredentials`. If omitted, `createActivities` builds the standalone defaults from settings.

### EventBus

Canonical sources: `EventBus` / `createNatsEventBus` in `packages/events/src/index.ts`, SSE in `apps/api/src/http/sse.ts`.

API and worker must share the same broker-backed EventBus binding. The production implementation is `createNatsEventBus(natsUrl, auth?)`; it handles session fanout, selfhosted request/reply, and agent events over one managed NATS connection. Postgres remains the durable event log, but live SSE depends on worker publishes reaching API subscribers cross-process.

Do not replace this with an in-memory bus in an embedded deployment. In-memory fanout only reaches subscribers in the same process and would make worker -> API live SSE silently disappear; clients would only recover on replay/gap backfill.

For embedded UIs that page historical timelines, prefer `GET .../events?compact=1` (or SDK `listEvents(..., { compact: true })`) for windowed replay. It coalesces consecutive delta fragments in the page while preserving first-member `sequence`; use `payload.coalescedUntil` as the resume cursor for the live SSE stream. Streaming/gap backfill should keep using raw sequence replay.

## Trust model

The embed boundary has a deliberate split of authority. Getting this wrong in
either direction creates real vulnerabilities (too little host gating) or
pointless coupling (host ownership of engine internals), so it is a contract:

**The host owns the perimeter and external identity.**

- Every request reaching the mounted api-router has already passed the HOST's
  authentication. OpenGeni's own checks (delegated tokens, API keys) are the
  second gate, not the first — an embedded deployment must never be reachable
  except through the host's front door.
- The host decides which of its principals maps to which OpenGeni
  account/workspace, and mints `ogd_` delegated tokens (with the deployment's
  delegation secret) to act as them. Admission policy that depends on the
  host's business state (plans, quotas, feature gates) enters through the
  entitlements port on the worker side.

**The engine owns its internal plumbing tokens.**

- First-party MCP delegated tokens, stream tokens, and NATS credentials are
  self-minted by the engine with its own secrets. They never leave the engine's
  trust domain (the host's process and infrastructure), so routing them through
  a host token issuer would add coupling without adding security. Do not expect
  a port for these; there isn't one on purpose.
- Corollary for hosts: protect the engine's secrets (delegation secret,
  encryption keys) exactly like your own signing keys — inside the engine's
  trust domain they are root authority.

**API-side admission is local by design.** The API validates structure,
permissions, and workspace scoping; host-specific admission (may this tenant
run another turn?) is enforced where the work actually starts — the worker's
entitlements port. A request can therefore be *accepted* by the API and still
be *declined* at run admission; hosts that want earlier rejection should gate
at their own perimeter, which they control.
