# OpenGeni Infrastructure Goal

This file is the source of truth for the current infrastructure work. Keep it updated as implementation details change, and do not treat the work as complete until every required gate is satisfied with evidence.

## End Goal

OpenGeni is ready for an open-source pull request that adds a robust, cloud-provider-agnostic, production-grade deployment platform and proves it works locally and in Azure, AWS, and GCP reference environments.

The final state must support:

- Local full-stack development with the existing Docker Compose path.
- Local Kubernetes development and conformance through the same Helm chart used for Azure reference verification.
- Kubernetes as the default workload plane for OpenGeni API, web, worker, migration jobs, telemetry collection, and optional in-cluster services, with production-grade probes, disruption budgets, topology spread, autoscaling, security contexts, network policies, service accounts, and secrets integration.
- Azure, AWS, and GCP as real reference deployment targets, each with cleanly separated resource names, tags/labels, ledgers, cleanup commands, and reproducible infrastructure definitions.
- Existing customer services for Postgres and Temporal, not only newly provisioned resources.
- Managed, external, and in-cluster modes where the primitive supports those modes.
- A deterministic deployment contract that agents, docs, Helm, Terraform, and conformance checks can all use.
- CI/CD for branch and pull-request preview deployments, including automatic PR environments, manual branch previews, deterministic teardown, and conformance smoke checks before a preview is declared healthy.
- Open, backend-agnostic observability that works the same way locally and across clouds: OpenTelemetry as the instrumentation and transport contract; Prometheus-compatible metrics; structured logs; trace export; optional self-hosted LGTM-style stack; and documented adapters to managed cloud observability backends.
- Clean, compact, and clear infra/deployment documentation and agent guidance. README, deployment docs, AGENTS notes, skill guidance, and examples must explain the production path without stale caveats, duplicated walls of text, or hidden assumptions.
- A private iteration flow: do not push a branch, open a PR, publish deployment endpoints, or expose premature work before all gates pass.

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

- Do not commit secrets, local `.env` files, Azure subscription identifiers that are not necessary examples, generated credentials, kubeconfigs, Terraform state, or customer-specific values.
- Do not print secret values to logs or final answers.
- Track every cloud resource created for this work in the provider ledger before or immediately after creation:
  - Azure: `docs/azure-resource-ledger.md`
  - AWS: `docs/aws-resource-ledger.md`
  - GCP: `docs/gcp-resource-ledger.md`
- Prefer least-privilege cloud identities and short-lived credentials.
- Treat sandbox credential exposure as explicit opt-in through preparation profiles and allowlists.
- Preserve OpenGeni's runtime architecture: API is the public surface, Postgres is durable truth, NATS is live fanout, Temporal is orchestration, workers own side effects, and sandboxes are isolated execution environments.
- Support both provisioned and existing Postgres/Temporal deployment modes.
- Keep all generated artifacts reproducible from source-controlled templates or scripts.
- Keep provider-specific infrastructure separated from the provider-neutral Kubernetes app layer. Cloud modules may vary, but the OpenGeni workload contract must stay stable.
- Keep infra/deployment docs and skills maintainable: short source-of-truth docs, clear operator commands, explicit provider differences, no obsolete evidence dumps in primary docs, and no overclaiming beyond verified behavior.
- Use official upstream charts/operators for production platform services whenever mature options exist. The OpenGeni Helm chart owns OpenGeni API, web, worker, migrations, and OpenGeni-specific integration resources; it must not become a bespoke replacement for NATS, Temporal, Postgres, secret-sync, TLS, or observability operators.

## Required Capabilities

The deployment foundation must describe and verify these primitives:

- Kubernetes runtime for API, web, worker, migrations, and support workloads with production-grade workload primitives: startup/readiness/liveness probes, PDBs, topology spread, HPA/KEDA-ready scaling hooks, service accounts, optional projected cloud identity annotations, pod/container security contexts, resource presets, and network policies with explicit ingress and egress intent.
- Postgres with pgvector for sessions, event log, documents, and indexes.
- Temporal endpoint, namespace, task queue, and worker connectivity.
- NATS endpoint for live fanout, with durable replay still backed by Postgres.
- Official upstream dependency integrations for production/self-hosted platform services:
  - NATS through the official NATS Helm chart or an existing managed/customer NATS endpoint.
  - Temporal through Temporal Cloud, an existing customer endpoint, or the official Temporal Helm chart connected to external persistence.
  - Postgres through managed cloud Postgres, an existing customer database, or a production-grade Postgres operator such as CloudNativePG for in-cluster self-hosting.
  - Secrets through External Secrets Operator, cloud-native secret stores, Vault, or equivalent operator-managed delivery.
  - TLS through cert-manager, cloud load balancer integrations, or an existing ingress/TLS stack.
  - Observability through OpenTelemetry Collector/Operator, Prometheus Operator CRDs, and documented managed-cloud/LGTM-compatible backends.
- S3-compatible object storage for local/self-contained modes and explicitly implemented provider adapters for production object stores: Azure Blob, AWS S3, and Google Cloud Storage.
- Secret delivery from Kubernetes Secrets for local smoke, and External Secrets Operator-compatible wiring for Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager/Parameter Store, GCP Secret Manager, or Vault.
- Ingress/TLS with long-lived SSE support and safe timeouts.
- OpenTelemetry-compatible traces, metrics, and structured logs, with a documented self-hosted reference using OpenTelemetry Collector plus Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Tempo/Mimir-compatible components and documented managed-cloud alternatives.
- Container registry and immutable image tags.
- Sandbox backend selection and readiness verification.
- Backup, restore, retention, and cleanup expectations for durable data.
- Auth/gateway boundary guidance until OpenGeni ships built-in auth, tenancy, RBAC, or API keys.
- Preview environment lifecycle: namespace/resource naming, image tag selection, Helm values generation, URL/DNS/TLS strategy, smoke/conformance execution, TTL/teardown, and cost controls.
- Documentation and skill hygiene: concise deployment docs, provider-specific quick starts, minimal AGENTS instructions, and updated OpenGeni skill guidance that points agents to current source files instead of copying stale operational history.

## Target Profiles

- `local-compose`: existing local Docker Compose stack plus local sandbox image.
- `local-kubernetes`: local Kubernetes cluster running the Helm chart with in-cluster dependencies for parity with the cloud workload shape.
- `kubernetes-external`: Kubernetes workloads connected to existing Postgres, Temporal, NATS, object storage, secrets, ingress, and observability.
- `azure-managed`: Azure reference deployment with managed Azure substrate where practical and OpenGeni workloads on AKS.
- `azure-existing-services`: AKS workload deployment connected to existing customer Postgres and Temporal.
- `aws-managed`: AWS reference deployment with EKS, ECR, S3, Secrets Manager integration, and managed Postgres where practical.
- `aws-existing-services`: EKS workload deployment connected to existing customer Postgres and Temporal.
- `gcp-managed`: GCP reference deployment with GKE, Artifact Registry, GCS, Secret Manager integration, and managed Postgres where practical.
- `gcp-existing-services`: GKE workload deployment connected to existing customer Postgres and Temporal.
- `preview-pr`: automatically created pull-request preview environment.
- `preview-branch`: manually requested branch preview environment.
- `self-contained-kubernetes`: optional profile for demos, air-gapped testing, or customers who want in-cluster dependencies.

## Platform Architecture Decision

OpenGeni should not build a bespoke platform controller before the deployment contract is proven. The clean target architecture is:

- **Provider-neutral app layer:** Helm chart plus conformance/preflight scripts define the OpenGeni workload contract.
- **Provider-specific substrate layer:** Terraform/OpenTofu roots or modules create cloud primitives and produce non-secret Helm values.
- **Official dependency layer:** production NATS, Temporal, Postgres, secret sync, ingress/TLS, and observability must be installed or referenced through official upstream charts/operators or managed services. OpenGeni-owned dependency templates are only disposable conformance fixtures for local development, CI, previews, and cloud smoke tests; they must stay off the documented production path and should be easy to replace with upstream charts/operators.
- **GitOps/preview layer:** generated Helm values and immutable images are deployable by GitHub Actions, Argo CD ApplicationSets, Flux, or a manual Helm command.
- **Observability layer:** OpenTelemetry is the stable contract. A cluster may export to a self-hosted LGTM-compatible stack or to Azure Monitor, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus/Grafana/CloudWatch/X-Ray-compatible endpoints, Google Managed Service for Prometheus/Cloud Trace/Cloud Logging-compatible endpoints, or another OTLP backend.
- **Secret layer:** local smoke may use Kubernetes Secrets; production should use External Secrets Operator or cloud-native workload identity with the provider secret store.

Research baseline to keep in mind while iterating:

- OpenTelemetry Operator manages Collectors and workload auto-instrumentation in Kubernetes.
- Prometheus Operator models scrape targets through `ServiceMonitor` and `PodMonitor`.
- Grafana LGTM-style stacks combine Loki logs, Grafana dashboards, Tempo traces, and Mimir/Prometheus metrics.
- External Secrets Operator syncs external secret stores into Kubernetes Secrets and supports major cloud secret managers.
- Argo CD ApplicationSet pull-request generators can create per-PR environments, but the repo should also support manual Helm/GitHub Actions previews without requiring Argo CD.
- Crossplane is a future option for Kubernetes-native multi-cloud control planes, but Terraform/OpenTofu roots are the safer first PR path because the repo already uses Terraform and operators can run it without installing a platform control plane.

## Azure Reference Expectations

The Azure path should be able to create or connect:

- Resource group tagged for cleanup.
- AKS cluster.
- Azure Container Registry or customer-provided registry.
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server with pgvector verified, or existing compatible Postgres.
- Temporal endpoint from Temporal Cloud, customer-provided Temporal, or a self-hosted profile.
- Azure Blob object storage for production file bytes, with optional S3-compatible/MinIO only for local and self-contained smoke deployments.
- Azure Key Vault or External Secrets integration.
- Ingress controller, DNS/TLS instructions, and SSE-compatible configuration.
- Azure Monitor or another OpenTelemetry export target.
- Workload identity or an equivalent secure secret-delivery strategy.

## AWS Reference Expectations

The AWS path should be able to create or connect:

- Resource group equivalent through tags and clean naming.
- EKS cluster.
- ECR repositories or customer-provided registry.
- Amazon RDS PostgreSQL with pgvector-compatible version and extensions verified, or existing compatible Postgres.
- Temporal endpoint from Temporal Cloud, customer-provided Temporal, or a self-hosted profile.
- S3 bucket for production file bytes, with optional S3-compatible/MinIO only for local and self-contained smoke deployments.
- AWS Secrets Manager or External Secrets integration.
- Ingress controller, DNS/TLS instructions, and SSE-compatible configuration.
- OTLP export to a self-hosted stack or AWS-managed observability targets.
- IRSA/EKS Pod Identity or an equivalent secure secret-delivery strategy.

## GCP Reference Expectations

The GCP path should be able to create or connect:

- Project/resource labels and cleanup-friendly naming.
- GKE cluster.
- Artifact Registry repositories or customer-provided registry.
- Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL with pgvector-compatible version and extensions verified, or existing compatible Postgres.
- Temporal endpoint from Temporal Cloud, customer-provided Temporal, or a self-hosted profile.
- GCS bucket for production file bytes, with optional S3-compatible/MinIO only for local and self-contained smoke deployments.
- GCP Secret Manager or External Secrets integration.
- Ingress controller, DNS/TLS instructions, and SSE-compatible configuration.
- OTLP export to a self-hosted stack or GCP-managed observability targets.
- GKE Workload Identity or an equivalent secure secret-delivery strategy.

## Verification Gates

The work is not complete until all applicable gates pass:

- `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun test`
- web production build
- integration tests for API, DB, NATS, Temporal workflow, and worker activity
- local full-stack smoke test through `bun run dev`
- local Kubernetes smoke/conformance test through the Helm chart
- deployment contract schema validation for every target profile
- Helm lint/template/schema validation
- Terraform fmt/validate/plan for Azure, AWS, and GCP reference modules
- preflight against existing Postgres and Temporal modes
- Azure, AWS, and GCP deployment smoke tests, unless a provider is explicitly blocked by credentials/quota and the blocker is documented in the provider ledger and audit
- conformance session run: create session, stream events, replay events, execute worker turn, verify persisted event history
- object storage upload/read verification from API and sandbox-relevant path; Azure Blob, S3, and GCS must pass API upload/download conformance without MinIO in their managed cloud profiles.
- sandbox backend readiness test
- scheduled task verification when Temporal is configured
- observability verification for logs, metrics, traces, and labels
- security checks: secret scan, no committed credentials, explicit sandbox env allowlist, network policy review
- preview environment create/update/destroy verification for PR and manual branch flows
- cleanup verification for all temporary Azure, AWS, and GCP resources

## Conformance Checks

The conformance suite should prove:

- API `/healthz` responds.
- API can connect to Postgres.
- Migrations are applied exactly once and are safe to rerun.
- pgvector extension is available when document search is enabled.
- API and worker can reach Temporal.
- Worker can poll the configured task queue.
- API and worker can publish/subscribe through NATS.
- SSE reconnect can backfill from Postgres by event sequence.
- Object storage can store, retrieve, and presign or expose objects as configured.
- Sandbox can start, receive the expected environment, and avoid unintended credential exposure.
- A scripted agent run can complete without live model dependency.
- Logs, metrics, and traces include enough correlation fields for production debugging.
- Preview deployments use isolated namespaces, isolated runtime secrets, immutable image references, conformance checks, and teardown commands.

## PR-Ready Definition

The final change is ready to push and open a PR only when:

- All required gates above pass or have a documented, acceptable reason for being skipped.
- `docs/azure-resource-ledger.md`, `docs/aws-resource-ledger.md`, and `docs/gcp-resource-ledger.md` are complete and any temporary resources are deleted or intentionally retained.
- README, SECURITY, AGENTS, and deployment docs match the implemented behavior.
- Infra/deployment docs and skills are clean, compact, current, and internally consistent; long evidence logs may stay in audit/ledger files, but operator-facing docs must stay readable.
- CI covers the new package/scripts without requiring live cloud credentials.
- Preview deployment workflows are present but safely gated so forks and untrusted PRs cannot access production secrets.
- The Azure, AWS, and GCP reference paths are reproducible from a clean checkout plus documented credentials.
- There are no untracked required artifacts.
- The diff contains no unrelated refactors or generated noise.

## Current Status

- Status: expanded and reopened after local checkpoint commit `8802d70`.
- Active goal: make this repo PR-ready for a world-class production Kubernetes and multi-cloud deployment platform.
- Completion notes: the previous Azure/local foundation is committed locally. The new scope is not complete until Kubernetes structure, observability, CI/CD previews, Azure cleanup, AWS, GCP, and full conformance evidence meet the PR-ready definition above.

- Fixed `docker/opengeni.Dockerfile` to include the new `packages/observability` workspace manifest before `bun install --frozen-lockfile`; verified API, worker, and web image builds.
- Upgraded local Kubernetes release `opengeni-local` to revision 4 with `opengeni-*-:local-k8s-observability` images and the chart-managed OpenTelemetry Collector enabled.
- Verified local Kubernetes expanded conformance after observability rollout: `bun run deployment:conformance -- --base-url http://127.0.0.1:28080 --object-connect-to opengeni-local-minio:9000:127.0.0.1:29000 --timeout-seconds 240 --json` passed API health, observability, live session run, event replay, SSE replay, manual scheduled-task dispatch, and file upload/download with session `be08079b-dde4-4db3-82b8-a51e5a76706a`, scheduled task `4ba0f319-cc52-4ba3-b15e-50522e32f751`, scheduled session `cce6db55-a172-40b0-8f4d-fd3e458eaa72`, and file `b8c55b3a-2832-4348-912c-69f93f5caa49`.
- Pushed ACR observability rollout tags for AKS: API digest `sha256:4a2f541b8644721694abca4f56911067250b984357c815a1d1ad0082d1aeb9ac`, worker digest `sha256:9267f6c12a4e23f7cb8690059fccf89c23fa36bcef854da5a5efaf4ca7d063ee`, and web digest `sha256:d797a70f08d0d3e072f1b5b6ba15677fef72db36d813365821a91e8833da744b`.
- Upgraded AKS release `opengeni-bootstrap` to Helm revision 18 with the chart-managed OpenTelemetry Collector enabled; the migration hook initially needed temporary old web/worker scale-down because the one-node reference cluster was at 96% requested memory, then completed and restored all desired pods.
- Verified AKS revision 18 running image IDs: API `sha256:4a2f541b8644721694abca4f56911067250b984357c815a1d1ad0082d1aeb9ac`, worker `sha256:9267f6c12a4e23f7cb8690059fccf89c23fa36bcef854da5a5efaf4ca7d063ee`, web `sha256:d797a70f08d0d3e072f1b5b6ba15677fef72db36d813365821a91e8833da744b`, and collector `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.139.0`.
- Verified AKS expanded conformance after observability rollout: `bun run deployment:conformance -- --base-url http://127.0.0.1:18080 --timeout-seconds 240 --json` passed API health, observability, live session run, event replay, SSE replay, manual scheduled-task dispatch, and Azure Blob upload/download with session `f1d16b1b-d139-4bca-afe4-b0ef2991057e`, scheduled task `a6a244f2-6ece-47f4-a825-f0159cee7f14`, scheduled session `266cb1d6-1f47-4543-a823-f102e2352c59`, and file `0823be7c-641d-40bc-8a45-7106c491e1dc`.
- Verified deployed AKS observability export evidence: `/metrics` exposed request counters and duration buckets for conformance routes, and the collector debug exporter logged OTLP traces plus Prometheus metrics after the conformance run.
- Documented minimum production dashboards, PromQL examples, and alerts for API health/errors/latency, worker activity health, scheduled-task dispatch, object storage, SSE replay, collector health, and sandbox credential hygiene in `docs/deployment.md`.
- Installed temporary `ingress-nginx` chart `4.15.1` in AKS with low resource requests for ingress/TLS verification; Azure assigned public VIP `4.175.162.38`.
- Upgraded AKS release `opengeni-bootstrap` to Helm revision 19 with TLS ingress enabled for `opengeni.4.175.162.38.sslip.io` and reduced the worker memory request to fit the tiny one-node reference cluster alongside ingress-nginx.
- Verified ingress TLS and API routing through the ingress controller service: `curl --resolve opengeni.4.175.162.38.sslip.io:18443:127.0.0.1 --cacert /tmp/opengeni-aks-ingress.crt https://opengeni.4.175.162.38.sslip.io:18443/healthz` returned API health, `/v1/config/client` returned client config, and `/v1/sessions/f1d16b1b-d139-4bca-afe4-b0ef2991057e/events/stream?after=0` replayed SSE events over HTTPS.
- Public Azure LoadBalancer reachability initially timed out because the temporary ingress-nginx service generated HTTP/HTTPS health probes to `/`; after annotating the service to use TCP health probes, Azure updated the probes and direct traffic started routing to ingress-nginx.
- Verified public Azure ingress reachability: direct HTTP `http://4.175.162.38/healthz` returned `200`, direct HTTPS `https://opengeni.4.175.162.38.sslip.io/healthz` returned OpenGeni API health with the smoke CA, and `https://opengeni.4.175.162.38.sslip.io/v1/config/client` returned client config.
- Verified public Azure TLS conformance with `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/tmp/opengeni-aks-ingress.crt bun run deployment:conformance -- --base-url https://opengeni.4.175.162.38.sslip.io --timeout-seconds 240 --skip-observability --json`: API health, live session run, event replay, SSE replay, manual scheduled-task dispatch, and Azure Blob upload/download passed with session `6ba5a497-12eb-4b79-be98-6ae808f3c5ad`, scheduled task `1281f751-34fa-4631-b3c0-b646f4af0869`, scheduled session `b577864a-5daf-45a8-b4fa-b674eb0ba914`, and file `8a76d117-35b1-417b-98f7-fd150b1b803a`; observability was intentionally checked on the internal API path rather than exposing `/metrics` publicly.
- Re-ran local/static gates after the AKS observability and ingress work: `git diff --check`, `helm lint deploy/helm/opengeni`, ingress/collector Helm template rendering, `terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/azure fmt -check`, `terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/azure validate`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun test`, `bun run check`, and `bun run test:integration` all passed.
- Added Helm `image.digest` support for API, worker, web, and migration images; production examples now show `tag@sha256` pinning.
- Upgraded AKS release `opengeni-bootstrap` to Helm revision 20 with digest-pinned API, worker, web, and migration images: API `opengeni-api:local-amd64-observability@sha256:4a2f541b8644721694abca4f56911067250b984357c815a1d1ad0082d1aeb9ac`, worker `opengeni-worker:local-amd64-observability@sha256:9267f6c12a4e23f7cb8690059fccf89c23fa36bcef854da5a5efaf4ca7d063ee`, and web `opengeni-web:local-amd64-observability@sha256:d797a70f08d0d3e072f1b5b6ba15677fef72db36d813365821a91e8833da744b`.
- Verified AKS expanded conformance after digest pinning: `bun run deployment:conformance -- --base-url http://127.0.0.1:18080 --timeout-seconds 240 --json` passed API health, observability, live session run, event replay, SSE replay, manual scheduled-task dispatch, and Azure Blob upload/download with session `0ce3a7f6-e0bd-4d63-a67b-1bd3901525ac`, scheduled task `e8e6f1f3-ca47-46b9-96bf-57038d610b88`, scheduled session `17762537-2f93-4369-a9ee-690c6606bc0d`, and file `137f8d39-6f65-4db5-a253-ebd16d6ce4b4`.
- Verified the `azure-existing-services` profile with live explicit endpoints by port-forwarding the existing AKS Postgres, Temporal, NATS, and API services while using Azure Blob HTTPS as the external object-storage endpoint. `bun run deployment:preflight -- --profile azure-existing-services --check-env --live --json` passed required environment checks plus Kubernetes namespace, Postgres TCP, Temporal TCP, NATS TCP, Azure Blob HTTP reachability, and API health probes without printing secret values.
- Verified local Docker sandbox readiness with private model credentials sourced in-memory: `bun run deployment:conformance -- --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 --sandbox-backend docker --timeout-seconds 300 --json` passed API health, observability, live session run, event replay, SSE replay, manual scheduled-task dispatch, and MinIO upload/download with session `8da30bbe-a2a6-480d-a448-67d04278925e`, scheduled task `085aba63-dd23-4b56-85bb-b003ef6e85ff`, scheduled session `dcb9e6ce-9f21-4b73-8f52-b5ac3d89d3cc`, and file `cbda4677-602d-4e73-bd7b-7cff0c539c17`.
- Verified Docker sandbox file mounts end-to-end: uploaded file `c0d0a1f7-9e55-41c4-a7cc-55d9273933c9`, attached it as a session file resource, required the agent to read `/workspace/files/c0d0a1f7-9e55-41c4-a7cc-55d9273933c9/sandbox-proof.txt` through the sandbox shell, and confirmed session `63d2fbaa-accf-4ccd-bc8f-79f45248237a` completed with exactly the file contents plus `agent.toolCall.*` events.
- Verified sandbox credential hygiene with `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_PREPARATION_PROFILES=none`: session `8fa1fea7-2b1e-4450-8e4b-22fab9fd00d7` used a sandbox tool call to check common model, Azure, ARM, and GitHub credential environment variable names and completed with `sandbox env safe`.
- Expanded CI deployment coverage to render digest-pinned Helm values and build API, worker, and web workload images for `linux/amd64`; live Azure conformance remains a documented manual/operator gate rather than a public PR workflow.
- Documented the production security boundary in `docs/deployment.md`: OpenGeni API needs an external auth/gateway layer before public exposure, production ingress requirements, safe secret-delivery patterns, and sandbox credential exposure rules.
- Attempted Modal-backed Azure Blob file-resource proof with local API/worker configured for Azure Blob and Modal. The first attempt failed with `ModalSandboxClient does not support manifest users yet`; runtime now sets `runAs` only for Docker. The second attempt failed with `ModalSandboxClient only supports ModalCloudBucketMountStrategy mount entries`; runtime now uses Modal cloud bucket mounts for S3-compatible storage and rejects Modal/Azure Blob with a clear compatibility error because the current SDK does not support that pairing.
- Updated Azure deployment contract and Helm example values so Azure Blob profiles default to `OPENGENI_SANDBOX_BACKEND=none` instead of claiming Modal compatibility for Azure Blob file mounts.
- Created temporary managed Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server `opengeni-codex-8092-pg-ne` in `northeurope` after Azure reported Flexible Server provisioning restricted in `westeurope`; recorded it in `docs/azure-resource-ledger.md`.
- Verified managed Postgres support: set `azure.extensions=PGCRYPTO,VECTOR`, applied OpenGeni migrations, confirmed extensions `pgcrypto` and `vector`, confirmed `pg_type` includes `vector`, and confirmed 11 public tables on database `opengeni`.
- Patched the Azure Terraform reference to allow-list `PGCRYPTO,VECTOR` for managed Postgres instead of only `VECTOR`, matching the live migration requirement.
- Attempted Docker-backed Azure Blob file-resource proof. The first attempt exposed a standard Azure Blob rclone endpoint bug (`account.https://account.blob.core.windows.net`); runtime now omits `endpointUrl` for standard Azure Blob account endpoints while preserving custom endpoints.
- Verified Docker-backed Azure Blob file mounts end-to-end after the endpoint fix: uploaded file `e07ba892-c092-4b01-abcb-8bc2fb11abd2`, attached it as a session file resource, required the agent to read `/workspace/files/e07ba892-c092-4b01-abcb-8bc2fb11abd2/sandbox-proof.txt`, and confirmed session `bc4f59ac-38af-4006-9d6f-eec43966b877` completed with exactly the file contents plus `agent.toolCall.*` events.
- Rebuilt and repushed the AKS worker image with the Azure Blob sandbox-storage fixes, deployed Helm revision 21, and verified worker readiness at `opengenicodex8092acr.azurecr.io/opengeni-worker:local-amd64-sandbox-storage@sha256:292aceafa79f58afca015bc78f1670557d2d3091ff5b176a533497a97a31c468`.
- Repaired AKS image pull for the new worker image by creating tracked temporary ACR token `opengeni-codex-8092-pull` scoped to `_repositories_pull`, replacing Kubernetes secret `acr-pull-temp`, deleting the initially exposed `password1`, and retaining only a 7-day `password2` in the cluster secret.
- Replaced the Modal/Azure Blob incompatibility with runtime file materialization: the worker reads attached Azure Blob objects server-side and passes inline file entries to the Modal sandbox, avoiding unsupported Modal Azure Blob mounts and avoiding a dependency on `curl` inside the Modal image.
- Live-verified Modal plus Azure Blob file resources without the API/Temporal stack: uploaded Azure Blob object `files/e388b663-f4e9-4d37-b0e5-f5d400233496/original/sandbox-proof.txt`, materialized it into a Modal sandbox, and confirmed the agent returned the exact content `modal-azure-blob-file-proof-64def23b-0c00-4aa4-97e6-a5738b9c8872`.
- Rebuilt and repushed the AKS worker image with Modal/Azure Blob materialization support, deployed Helm revision 22, and verified worker readiness at `opengenicodex8092acr.azurecr.io/opengeni-worker:local-amd64-modal-azure-materialization@sha256:9ef2c21fcf679bde85aabf1f53e1db1c41256363e7e89fdfd019526734abfc16`.
- Re-verified public Azure TLS conformance after the revision 22 worker rollout: `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/tmp/opengeni-aks-ingress.crt bun run deployment:conformance -- --base-url https://opengeni.4.175.162.38.sslip.io --timeout-seconds 240 --skip-observability --json` passed API health, live session run, event replay, SSE replay, manual scheduled-task dispatch, and Azure Blob upload/download with session `be952e87-6bd0-4494-ab7c-7247f5f8e940`, scheduled task `6af60d39-5a0f-4a9b-9115-196a8ec6fda9`, scheduled session `9158d46d-6b7a-4e93-9f7a-6ecab85abf06`, and file `f60b9b36-27c5-4b95-a8a3-24efe640988f`.
- Deleted temporary managed Postgres server `opengeni-codex-8092-pg-ne` after proof and removed `/tmp/opengeni-managed-pg.env`; active AKS/ACR/Key Vault/Azure Storage resources are intentionally retained for continued deployed verification and have cleanup commands in `docs/azure-resource-ledger.md`.
- Re-ran AWS Terraform after switching to the AWS SSO admin profile and created the AWS reference substrate in account `066730217701/us-east-1`: EKS cluster `opengeni-codex-8092-eks`, managed node group `system`, ECR repositories, S3 bucket `opengenicodex8092-files-20260513121826757000000002`, Secrets Manager secret `opengeni-codex-8092/runtime`, VPC/subnets/IGW/route table, EKS OIDC provider, OpenGeni runtime IRSA role, and EBS CSI add-on IRSA role.
- Fixed the AWS Terraform root so ECR repositories are scoped under `name_prefix`, OpenGeni workloads receive least-privilege S3 access through IRSA, and the EKS `aws-ebs-csi-driver` managed add-on uses its own IRSA role instead of relying on node instance role credentials.
- Pushed AWS image tag `aws-smoke-a20c666-202605131420` for API, worker, and web to ECR and recorded digests in `docs/aws-resource-ledger.md`.
- Installed the `opengeni-aws` Helm release on EKS with in-cluster Postgres, Temporal, NATS, OpenTelemetry Collector, native AWS S3 object storage, IRSA, and no MinIO. The first install exposed a missing EBS CSI configuration; after applying the Terraform-owned EBS CSI IRSA fix, the Postgres PVC bound to EBS volume `vol-06be118aafcc80f0b` and all workloads became available.
- Verified EKS S3 conformance: `bun run deployment:conformance -- --base-url http://127.0.0.1:48080 --timeout-seconds 180 --json` passed API health, Prometheus metrics, live session run, event replay, SSE replay, scheduled task dispatch, and S3 upload/download; session `776ad678-5baa-4cf8-8697-5d28a61f0e94`, scheduled-task session `acdbaaa0-4a29-446d-93bd-811ace45cc8a`, file `1244dce4-2956-47e4-a3de-77e85efd424e`.
- Tightened the dependency-fixture boundary after review: cloud managed deployment contracts and example values now require external Temporal/NATS placeholders instead of chart-owned Temporal/NATS, Docker Compose and Helm MinIO fixtures use pinned release tags instead of `latest`, and CI rejects floating `latest` images in Docker Compose and Helm chart files.
- Added a compact production dependency map in `docs/deployment.md` that points operators to official NATS, Temporal, CloudNativePG, External Secrets, TLS, and observability layers while keeping OpenGeni chart responsibilities limited to OpenGeni workloads and integration resources.
- Hardened the live Azure Blob storage account to match the Terraform reference: nested public blob access disabled, blob versioning enabled, and seven-day blob/container delete retention enabled.
- Patched Azure Terraform to model private Azure Blob access, AKS node-pool upgrade settings, and optional AKS Microsoft Defender workspace wiring. Existing Azure resources were imported into temporary uncommitted state under `/tmp`; `terraform plan` in bootstrap mode returned no changes, and complete mode with explicit external Postgres/Temporal hosts produced output-only changes and no Azure resource changes.
- Re-ran the preferred AKS kubelet `AcrPull` role assignment with the current Azure principal and an isolated local service-principal login; both failed with `AuthorizationFailed` for `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`, so the documented operator action remains required for the preferred long-lived image-pull path.
- Deleted stale AKS resources after Azure Blob became the active object store: `opengeni-runtime-live` secret and `data-opengeni-bootstrap-minio-0` PVC. Verified all retained AKS pods are running and only the Postgres PVC disk remains.
- Final verification after Terraform/storage cleanup: `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, `bun run check`, `bun run test:integration`, `git diff --check`, Helm lint/template rendering with digest-pinned API/worker/web/migration images, `terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/azure fmt -check`, `terraform -chdir=deploy/terraform/azure validate`, imported-state Terraform plan, and targeted committed-secret pattern scan passed. The secret scan matched only placeholders and synthetic test values.

## Remaining Operator Actions

- For a long-lived Azure environment, have an Azure operator with `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` grant AKS kubelet `AcrPull` on the ACR and then remove `acr-pull-temp`.
- Replace smoke-only public TLS, ingress, and in-cluster Postgres/Temporal choices with the target production services for a real customer environment.
- Keep active Azure reference resources intentionally retained only while deployed verification continues; delete them with the ledger cleanup commands when the live environment is no longer needed.
