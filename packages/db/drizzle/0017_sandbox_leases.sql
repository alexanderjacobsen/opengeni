-- Sandbox singleton lease + refcounted holders + the cross-workspace reaper sweep.
--
-- The SOLE enforcer of one-box-per-group (P1.1; design-of-record
-- 08-implementation-plan.md P1.1 + modules/01-lease.md, re-keyed to
-- sandbox_group_id per addendum B.2). Two tables, authored GROUP-keyed from the
-- start so today's 1:1 world (sandbox_group_id == session id, set in 0018) is a
-- behavior-preserving no-op and the shared-sandbox surface (P1.4) needs no
-- re-key later.
--
-- The three Criticals land here together:
--   * CAS keys   — every lease op keyed (workspace_id, sandbox_group_id).
--   * meter key  — last_meter_at/last_meter_tick shape (warm_seconds accrues
--                  idempotent on (sandbox_group_id, lease_epoch, last_meter_tick)
--                  in P2.1; the column shape lands here).
--   * envelope split — resume_backend_id + resume_state fold the group's box
--                  recovery envelope onto the lease (no per-session join).
--
-- lease_epoch is INTEGER (not bigint/int8): the lease-epoch spike proved
-- postgres-js returns int8 from a raw query as a JS STRING, so the strict
-- epoch-fence compare (row.lease_epoch !== expectedEpoch) was always-true and
-- fenced every turn; an integer/int4 column comes back as a JS number, which
-- restores the fence. Epochs never approach 2^31, so the narrower type loses
-- nothing.
--
-- sandbox_group_id is a BARE uuid, DELIBERATELY NOT an FK to sessions(id): the
-- value is a session id or an ancestor's id in the same workspace; an FK would
-- let a founder's deletion cascade-kill a box still in use by a spawned session.
-- The live lease row IS the materialization of "this group has a box" (there is
-- no sandbox_groups table).
--
-- DDL is INERT until P1.2 wires it (flag sandboxOwnershipEnabled); this
-- migration only creates the tables, indexes, RLS, grants, and the sweep fn.

-- ============== sandbox_leases (exactly one logical row per group) ===========
-- The UNIQUE (workspace_id, sandbox_group_id) index is the only hardware that
-- prevents a second box. CAS, epoch, and FOR UPDATE all layer on top of it.
