-- Session recordings — the durable index for the "agent films itself proving
-- the fix" loop (P4.3; design-of-record 08-implementation-plan.md P4.3 +
-- modules/05-computer-use.md §3.5).
--
-- One row per recording: an ffmpeg x11grab of the SAME :0 framebuffer humans
-- watch (Channel B), captured while the box is held warm, finalized by reading
-- the bytes off the box and PUTting them to @opengeni/storage IN THE SAME
-- process that holds the resumed-by-id handle (the turn activity for an on-turn
-- recording; the API in-process for an off-turn finalize) — the bytes are NEVER
-- a Temporal payload (F10). The signed-URL replay route reads `storage_key`.
--
-- The acknowledgment / un-redacted-pixel consent (P3.2) gates whether a viewer
-- may watch the LIVE desktop; a recording artifact is gated by sessions:read on
-- the per-fetch signed-URL route (the row carries no long-lived URL). Recordings
-- are un-redacted (the framebuffer may show creds on screen), so recordingEnabled
-- is an opt-in per deployment and the artifact inherits workspace RLS.
--
-- DDL is INERT until the worker/API wire it (flag sandboxDesktopEnabled); this
-- migration only creates the table, indexes, RLS, and grants. Forward-only,
-- behavior-preserving: no existing row references it.
