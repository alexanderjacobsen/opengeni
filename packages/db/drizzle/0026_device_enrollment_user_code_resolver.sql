-- The user_code → (account_id, workspace_id) resolver for the click-Grant approve
-- page lookup (self-hosted enrollment UX, design 11 §B.1). Companion to the
-- device_code resolver in 0025 (resolve_device_enrollment_request).
--
-- WHY a SECURITY DEFINER resolver: POST /v1/enrollments/device/lookup is the
-- approve page reading machine details for a user_code WITHOUT a workspace in the
-- path — the user_code is globally unique among LIVE (status='pending') rows (the
-- 0025 partial unique index device_enrollment_requests_user_code_pending_idx). A
-- scoped opengeni_app connection is under FORCE RLS and cannot read a row to learn
-- which workspace it belongs to, so — exactly like 0025's device_code resolver —
-- this returns ONLY the (account_id, workspace_id) for the PENDING row matching the
-- code. The DAO then re-reads the FULL row under the resolved workspace's RLS scope
-- and the ROUTE re-checks the caller holds an enrollments:read grant in THAT
-- workspace, so the user_code is the capability and no broad read escapes RLS.
--
-- PENDING-ONLY: the partial unique index guarantees AT MOST ONE pending row per
-- user_code, so the resolver is unambiguous; a terminal (approved/denied/consumed)
-- row's recycled code is intentionally invisible here (lookup is for the live
-- approve decision only).
--
-- ROLLBACK (forward-only repo, but cleanly reversible):
--   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS opengeni_private.resolve_pending_device_enrollment_by_user_code(text);
