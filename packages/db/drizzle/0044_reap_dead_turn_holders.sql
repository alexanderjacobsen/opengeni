-- 0044_reap_dead_turn_holders.sql
-- Dead-worker turn holders were TTL-exempt forever: a live turn refreshes its
-- holder every 10s (even a legit multi-day turn), but a worker killed without
-- cleanup (SIGKILL/OOM/deploy churn) leaves a holder whose heartbeat is frozen.
-- Left in place it pins refcount >= 1 FOREVER, so the lease never drains, the
-- reaper never persists /workspace, and the box rides the provider hard-timeout
-- to an UNPERSISTED death (2026-07-06 staging deploy churn left turn holders
-- frozen for hours). Reap turn holders whose heartbeat is older than the
-- caller-supplied horizon. A live holder is touched every 10s from the moment
-- it is registered (the worker's holder-liveness loop covers the warmup;
-- the turn heartbeat covers the run), so the horizon the worker passes
-- (warming-budget + lease-TTL) is generous defense-in-depth, never a bound a
-- live path can reach; a redispatched turn re-acquires under a NEW holder id,
-- so a live execution is never touched.
