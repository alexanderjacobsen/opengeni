# @opengeni/react

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a4f370f: Carve the connected-machine UI into a dedicated `@opengeni/react/machines` subpath, and add `workingDir` to the SDK create-session request.

  - **`@opengeni/react`**: the bring-your-own-compute surface (`useMachines`, `MachinesDashboard`, `MachineCard`, `MachineDockBar`, `SharedMachineDisclosure`, `MachineStatusPill`, `ConnectionStatusPill`, `ConnectionDot`, `MachineMetrics`, `EnrollmentDeviceFlow`, `EnrollmentConsent`, `connectionStatusForState`, and the `MachineView` / `MachineState` / `MachineKind` / `MachinesResponse` / `MetricSample` view-model types) now lives at `@opengeni/react/machines`. The root keeps re-exporting it for backwards compatibility — **non-breaking** — but the root re-export is **deprecated** and will move in a future major. Import from `@opengeni/react/machines` going forward.
  - **`@opengeni/sdk`**: `CreateSessionRequest` gains an optional `workingDir?: string` field — the host working directory for a connected-machine target (the agent runs there; defaults to the machine's launch dir). Ignored for managed sandboxes.

- d9d7743: Render the self-hosted desktop stream: a PNG-frame canvas client for `transport: "relay-frames"`.

  Self-hosted machines stream their desktop as PNG-per-frame protobuf datagrams over the relay (not RFB), so the noVNC/RFB viewer could never render them — the desktop went "warm" but the live stream never came up. This adds `useRelayFrameStream`, a view-only canvas renderer that opens the relay channel, decodes each PNG frame, and paints it (latest-wins backpressure so a slow decode never queues). `useDesktopStream` now dispatches on `DesktopStream.transport`: `"vnc-ws"` → noVNC (Modal boxes), `"relay-frames"` → the frame renderer (self-hosted machines). The `DesktopStream.transport` / `client` unions gain `"relay-frames"` / `"frames"`. View-only in v1 (matches the machine's read-only mode); interactive input is a follow-up.

- d718d37: Render `session_interrupt` as a distinct worker action in the timeline. When a manager agent stops or steers a session it spawned (the new first-party `session_interrupt` MCP tool), the projection now emits a dedicated `interrupt` worker item carrying the target `workerSessionId` and the `mode` (`"stop"` | `"steer"`), and the activity rail titles it accordingly ("Stopping worker" / "Steering worker" / "Worker stopped" / "Worker steered") instead of a generic tool-call row — matching the existing `spawn` / `message` worker rendering.
- ccebacd: Completed, failed, and cancelled turns now fold their activity behind a TurnSummary chip in MessageTimeline, with failed turns starting expanded so their failure text remains visible.
- 5a289d0: Settled turns now collapse the entire turn span behind one summary chip, leaving only the final agent message visible until expanded. Expanding the chip reveals mid-turn narration and nested per-cluster activity summaries.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 48c0d2e: Add session titles. A session now has a short display title that the agent generates itself: on the genesis turn a hidden, non-persisted directive asks the agent to call the new `set_session_title` tool, so the session is named on its own model with no extra LLM call. Users (and agents with `sessions:control`, via `set_other_session_title`) can rename; a user-set title is permanent and is never clobbered by agent writes.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: `Session.title` / `Session.titleSource`, `UpdateSessionRequest`, and the `session.title_set` event.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: `client.updateSession(workspaceId, sessionId, { title })`.
  - `@opengeni/react`: `useSession().updateTitle(...)`, live `session.title_set` handling, and `sessionDisplayTitle` now prefers `session.title`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a1c82c5: Add the world-class timeline tool-call renderer module and the sandbox-surfacing client surface to `@opengeni/react`.

  - **Timeline renderers**: per-tool disclosure cards (full-row toggle, keyboard-accessible), screenshots → lightbox, theme-aware Pierre diffs, turn-collapse summary chips, sub-agent worker/goal landmarks, a consumer-extensible tool registry, and complete state handling (running / complete / failed / cancelled), each with its own affordance.
  - **Sandbox surfacing**: file/terminal/git/desktop hooks and components (`useSandboxFiles`, `useSandboxTerminal`, `useSandboxGit`, `useDesktopStream`, `useTerminalStream`, `useSessionCapabilities`, `SandboxFiles`, `SandboxTerminal`, `DesktopViewer`, `WorkspaceDock`, Pierre diff/file views, `CodeEditor`).

  All additive; `MessageTimeline`'s `items` contract is unchanged. The internal `compactPayloadPreview` helper was removed from the public surface.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [a78a09b]
  - @opengeni/sdk@0.3.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- daaffd7: Chat `MessageTimeline` now renders message bodies as **markdown by default** (react-markdown + remark-gfm, themed to the `og-*` design tokens — headings, lists, GFM task lists, inline/fenced code, blockquotes, tables, links). The `renderMessageText` prop still overrides the default renderer.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 21c1535: Initial public release of the OpenGeni client packages.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: shared zod wire-contract schemas and types.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: zero-dependency, framework-agnostic TypeScript client with typed API, session lifecycle, and SSE streaming (reconnect + replay-by-sequence).
  - `@opengeni/react`: React hooks and styled components built on `@opengeni/sdk`.

  All three now ship ESM + `.d.ts` builds via tsup and are published to npm with provenance.
