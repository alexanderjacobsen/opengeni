/**
 * Read-path sanitizer for replayed conversation history (issue: orphaned
 * tool outputs brick a session).
 *
 * Conversation truth is persisted as a flat list of SDK history items in
 * `session_history_items` and replayed verbatim into the model on every turn.
 * The OpenAI Responses API rejects the whole request (HTTP 400) when that list
 * violates its tool-call pairing rules — most destructively:
 *
 *   `400 No tool call found for function call output with call_id <X>`
 *
 * when a `function_call_result` (a.k.a. function_call_output) has no matching
 * `function_call` earlier in the list. Because the corrupt item is replayed on
 * every subsequent turn, one orphaned output permanently bricks the session
 * across revival — it stays dead until the row is hand-deleted.
 *
 * This module is the reliability net: before history items are sent to the
 * model they pass through `sanitizeHistoryItemsForModel`, which removes any
 * item that would make the request invalid. It mirrors the SDK's own
 * `dropOrphanToolCalls` continuation logic (which only runs over the SDK's
 * in-memory `state.history`, not over rows we reload from the database) so a
 * reloaded history is shaped exactly like a freshly-generated one.
 *
 * It is a pure function over plain JSON item shapes (no SDK import, no I/O) so
 * it is cheap to unit-test exhaustively. It NEVER mutates its input items and
 * NEVER touches the stored rows — only the in-memory copy sent to the model is
 * filtered, keeping the persisted audit trail intact.

 * Sanitize a replayed history item list into a sequence the Responses API

 *
 * Rules, each motivated by a concrete 400 the API raises:
 *
 *  1. Drop every tool-call RESULT whose matching tool CALL does not appear
 *     earlier in the list. This is the session-bricking orphan: a
 *     `function_call_result` with no preceding `function_call` of the same
 *     `call_id`. ("No tool call found for function call output…")
 *
 *  2. Drop every tool CALL that has no matching RESULT anywhere after it.
 *     The Responses API requires each tool call to be settled by its output
 *     before the conversation can continue; a dangling call left in replayed
 *     history 400s with "No tool output found for function call…". Dropping
 *     the dangling call (rather than synthesizing a fake output) is what the
 *     SDK itself does for in-memory continuation, so a reloaded history is
 *     shaped identically. The matching result, if it later exists, is kept;
 *     only genuinely unpaired calls are removed.
 *
 *  3. Drop any `reasoning` item that immediately precedes (across a run of
 *     reasoning items) a dropped tool call. The Responses API ties an
 *     encrypted reasoning item to the tool call it produced; a reasoning item
 *     orphaned by rule 2 trips "Item 'rs_…' of type 'reasoning' was provided
 *     without its required following item". Mirrors the SDK's
 *     `dropReasoningItemsPrecedingDroppedCalls`.
 *
 * A `call_id` is paired only when BOTH a call and a result of the matching
 * types exist with that id, the call appearing before the result. Calls and
 * results that satisfy that survive untouched.

 *
 * USED FOR `compaction` items only on the history-items read path: a foreign
 * `compaction` summary carries account-bound `encrypted_content` but its summary
 * is real conversation content that must be preserved, so we strip only the blob
 * (we do NOT drop the whole item). Foreign `reasoning` items are instead dropped

 * the foreign `rs_…` id and rejects a reasoning item that has a foreign id and no
 * encrypted_content (so blanking the blob alone is not enough — see
 * {@link applyCodexHistoryStrip}).
 *
 * The SDK's Responses converter reads the blob via `providerData.encryptedContent`
 * (camel) or `providerData.encrypted_content` (snake); persisted rows use the
 * snake form, but we delete both casings defensively. We also clear a top-level
 * `encrypted_content` (the `compaction`-item shape) belt-and-braces — that blob
 * is likewise source-bound. Only `reasoning` and `compaction` items are touched;
 * messages, tool calls, and tool outputs pass through untouched by reference.

 * WHY THIS LIVES AT THE WIRE LEVEL (not the input-item filter). The input-item
 * normalizer above ({@link normalizeComputerCallActions}, wired as a
 * callModelInputFilter) runs BEFORE the SDK's responses converter
 * (`convertAgentItemToResponsesInput`). That converter then re-derives the wire
 * payload from the item: when `actions` is present it emits BOTH
 * `{action: ..., actions: [...]}`, and when only `action` is present it emits
 * `action`-only. It can NEVER emit actions-only. Probed live against the
 * deployed Azure gpt-5.5-2026-04-24 GA computer tool (`{type:"computer"}`):
 *   - `action`-only  -> 400 "Computer call input must include exactly one of
 *                       `action` or `actions`." (rejected)
 *   - both           -> 400 same message (rejected)
 *   - `actions`-only -> passes the action/actions structural validation
 * So neither the input-filter nor the converter can produce an accepted body.
 * The ONLY seam that sees — and can rewrite — the final serialized JSON is a
 * custom `fetch` on the OpenAI client (it runs after the converter and after
 * `responses.create` serialization). This function is that rewriter's core.
 *
 * It collapses each computer_call to actions-only: it prefers an existing
 * non-empty `actions` array, else wraps the singular `action` into
 * `actions:[action]`, then deletes `action`. A computer_call with neither field
 * is left untouched (nothing to derive; let the provider report it).
 *
 * Mutates `body` in place (the caller has already JSON.parsed a private copy of

/**
 * Backstop for the action-timeout 400: walk the `input` array of a serialized
 * Responses request body and replace any `computer_call_output` item whose
 * `output.image_url` is an empty string, null, undefined, or otherwise not a
 * non-empty string with the 1×1 transparent PNG placeholder data URI.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NEEDED. When a computer ACTION (click/type/scroll/drag) times out
 * at the 15-second yield window `SandboxComputer.x()` throws `ComputerActionError`.
 * The agents-core SDK `toolExecution.mjs` catch block sets `output = ''` and then
 * builds the wire item:
 *
 *   `{type:"computer_call_output", output:{type:"computer_screenshot", image_url:""}}`
 *
 * Azure rejects the whole request with:
 *
 *   `400 Invalid 'input[N].output.image_url'. Expected a valid URL, but got a
 *    value with an invalid format.`
 *
 * Our screenshot() fail-loud guard (which throws on empty frames) only runs when
 * the SDK calls screenshot() on a SUCCESS path — not on this action-error catch
 * path that sets output='' directly. This wire-level rewrite is the only seam that
 * catches both paths regardless of how the empty image_url was produced. It runs
 * in the same `computerCallNormalizingFetch` wrapper, so a single parse/rewrite
 * pass covers both the action/actions-only rewrite and this placeholder injection.
 *
 * Mutates `body` in place (the caller has already JSON.parsed a private copy).
 * Returns `true` iff at least one image_url was replaced.

/**
 * Wrap a `fetch` so every outbound OpenAI Responses request body that contains a
 * `computer_call` is rewritten to the ACTIONS-ONLY shape (see

 * any `computer_call_output` item with an empty/missing `output.image_url` is
 * patched with the 1×1 transparent PNG placeholder (see
 * {@link rewriteEmptyComputerCallOutputImageUrls}).
 *
 * Installed as the `fetch:` option on the Azure OpenAI client, this is the
 * lowest reachable seam — below the agents-core input filter and below the SDK's
 * responses converter — so it neutralizes the converter's both-fields synthesis
 * regardless of what the input item carried, and backstops the action-timeout
 * empty image_url regardless of how it was produced.
 *
 * Surgical and cheap: it only parses the body when it is a string that contains
 * the prefix `"computer_call` (matching both `"computer_call"` action items and
 * `"computer_call_output"` result items). Every other request — non-computer-use
 * turns, streaming SSE responses, non-string bodies — forwards untouched, the
 * SAME `init` reference, so streaming and other providers are unaffected. A JSON
 * parse failure or a no-op rewrite also forwards the original `init` unchanged.
 *
 * Typed structurally (the `(input, init) => Promise<Response>` call signature)
 * rather than as the DOM `typeof fetch` so it omits the `preconnect` static the
 * global type carries; this matches the OpenAI SDK's `Fetch` option, which only
 * needs the call signature. The wiring site passes it as the client `fetch:`.
