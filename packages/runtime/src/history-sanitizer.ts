/**
 * Read-path sanitizer for replayed conversation history (issue: orphaned
 * tool outputs brick a session).
 *
 * Conversation truth is persisted as a flat list of SDK history items in
 * `session_history_items` and replayed verbatim into the model on every turn.
 * The OpenAI Responses API rejects the whole request (HTTP 400) when that list
 * violates its tool-call pairing rules — most destructively:
 *
 *   `400 No tool call found for function call output with call_id <X>`
 *
 * when a `function_call_result` (a.k.a. function_call_output) has no matching
 * `function_call` earlier in the list. Because the corrupt item is replayed on
 * every subsequent turn, one orphaned output permanently bricks the session
 * across revival — it stays dead until the row is hand-deleted.
 *
 * This module is the reliability net: before history items are sent to the
 * model they pass through `sanitizeHistoryItemsForModel`, which removes any
 * item that would make the request invalid. It mirrors the SDK's own
 * `dropOrphanToolCalls` continuation logic (which only runs over the SDK's
 * in-memory `state.history`, not over rows we reload from the database) so a
 * reloaded history is shaped exactly like a freshly-generated one.
 *
 * It is a pure function over plain JSON item shapes (no SDK import, no I/O) so
 * it is cheap to unit-test exhaustively. It NEVER mutates its input items and
 * NEVER touches the stored rows — only the in-memory copy sent to the model is
 * filtered, keeping the persisted audit trail intact.

 *
 * Rules, each motivated by a concrete 400 the API raises:
 *
 *  1. Drop every tool-call RESULT whose matching tool CALL does not appear
 *     earlier in the list. This is the session-bricking orphan: a
 *     `function_call_result` with no preceding `function_call` of the same
 *     `call_id`. ("No tool call found for function call output…")
 *
 *  2. Drop every tool CALL that has no matching RESULT anywhere after it.
 *     The Responses API requires each tool call to be settled by its output
 *     before the conversation can continue; a dangling call left in replayed
 *     history 400s with "No tool output found for function call…". Dropping
 *     the dangling call (rather than synthesizing a fake output) is what the
 *     SDK itself does for in-memory continuation, so a reloaded history is
 *     shaped identically. The matching result, if it later exists, is kept;
 *     only genuinely unpaired calls are removed.
 *
 *  3. Drop any `reasoning` item that immediately precedes (across a run of
 *     reasoning items) a dropped tool call. The Responses API ties an
 *     encrypted reasoning item to the tool call it produced; a reasoning item
 *     orphaned by rule 2 trips "Item 'rs_…' of type 'reasoning' was provided
 *     without its required following item". Mirrors the SDK's
 *     `dropReasoningItemsPrecedingDroppedCalls`.
 *
 * A `call_id` is paired only when BOTH a call and a result of the matching
 * types exist with that id, the call appearing before the result. Calls and
 * results that satisfy that survive untouched.

/**
 * Normalize `computer_call` items so each carries EXACTLY ONE of the two

 *
 * The OpenAI Agents SDK 0.11.6 `computer_call` schema (protocol.mjs) carries
 * BOTH the legacy singular `action` and the GA batched `actions`, each
 * `.optional()`, and only requires "at least one" (its superRefine errors only
 * when both are absent). The Azure computer-use endpoint is stricter: it
 * requires EXACTLY one and rejects the whole request with
 *
 *   `400 Computer call input must include exactly one of `action` or `actions`.`
 *
 * when an emitted `computer_call` carries both (observed live: a screenshot
 * call carrying `action:{type:"screenshot"}` AND `actions:[{type:"screenshot"}]`).
 *
 * Which singular do we keep? LIVE-PROVEN against the deployed Azure deployment
 * (gpt-5.5-2026-04-24): for gpt-5.5 the SDK serializes the GA computer tool as
 * `{type:"computer"}` (not the legacy `computer_use_preview`), and that GA tool
 * accepts ONLY the batched plural `actions`. Probing all three shapes:
 *   - `action`-only  -> 400 "exactly one of action or actions" (STILL rejected)
 *   - `actions`-only -> passes the action/actions structural validation
 *   - both           -> 400 "exactly one …"
 * The "exactly one" wording is misleading: only the `actions`-only form is
 * accepted by the GA tool. So when both are present we KEEP `actions` (the GA
 * batched plural) and DROP `action`. Calls that already carry exactly one field
 * — or the legacy `action`-only form — pass through untouched (this transform's
 * sole job is to resolve the both-present conflict, not to rewrite singulars).
 *
 * Pure and non-mutating: only the conflicting item(s) are cloned; every other
 * item passes through by reference (byte-identical). Unlike
 * {@link sanitizeHistoryItemsForModel} (which only *filters* items), this is a
 * read-path *transform* of a single item's shape.

 * Rewrite EVERY `computer_call` item in a serialized Responses request body to

 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES AT THE WIRE LEVEL (not the input-item filter). The input-item
 * normalizer above ({@link normalizeComputerCallActions}, wired as a
 * callModelInputFilter) runs BEFORE the SDK's responses converter
 * (`convertAgentItemToResponsesInput`). That converter then re-derives the wire
 * payload from the item: when `actions` is present it emits BOTH
 * `{action: ..., actions: [...]}`, and when only `action` is present it emits
 * `action`-only. It can NEVER emit actions-only. Probed live against the
 * deployed Azure gpt-5.5-2026-04-24 GA computer tool (`{type:"computer"}`):
 *   - `action`-only  -> 400 "Computer call input must include exactly one of
 *                       `action` or `actions`." (rejected)
 *   - both           -> 400 same message (rejected)
 *   - `actions`-only -> passes the action/actions structural validation
 * So neither the input-filter nor the converter can produce an accepted body.
 * The ONLY seam that sees — and can rewrite — the final serialized JSON is a
 * custom `fetch` on the OpenAI client (it runs after the converter and after
 * `responses.create` serialization). This function is that rewriter's core.
 *
 * It collapses each computer_call to actions-only: it prefers an existing
 * non-empty `actions` array, else wraps the singular `action` into
 * `actions:[action]`, then deletes `action`. A computer_call with neither field
 * is left untouched (nothing to derive; let the provider report it).
 *
 * Mutates `body` in place (the caller has already JSON.parsed a private copy of
 * the request body). Returns `true` iff at least one computer_call was changed.
