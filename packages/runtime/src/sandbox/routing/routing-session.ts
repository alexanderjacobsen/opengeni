// `RoutingSandboxSession` — the per-session hot-swap routing proxy (M7).
//
// THE load-bearing SDK finding (dossier §10.3 / §20-M7): when a box is injected
// NON-OWNED into a turn (`ownedSandbox.session`), the agent SDK's sandbox
// capabilities bind to that ONE session OBJECT ONCE and call ITS methods
// (`exec`/`execCommand`/`readFile`/`listDir`/`resolveExposedPort`/…) per tool
// call WITHOUT re-resolving the session. So to make the active sandbox flippable
// mid-turn we cannot swap the object the SDK holds — we must give the SDK ONE
// STABLE session-shaped object that, on EACH method call, re-reads the
// per-session active pointer `(active_sandbox_id, active_epoch)` and DISPATCHES
// to the CURRENTLY-active backend session (Modal or selfhosted).
//
// The contract (dossier §10.3):
//   - ONE stable object implementing the `SandboxSessionLike` structural surface.
//   - On EVERY op, re-read `(activeSandboxId, activeEpoch)` via `readPointer`.
//   - Cache the resolved backend session keyed by `activeEpoch`; when the epoch
//     changes mid-turn (a swap bumped it), re-resolve so the NEXT op hits the new
//     backend. Single active at a time (NOT parallel multi-attach).
//   - An in-flight op fenced by a STALE `active_epoch` (the backend rejects with a
//     fence error, OR the pointer moved under us between read and dispatch)
//     RETRIES against the new active sandbox — reusing the existing fenced-retry
//     role. Bounded retries so a pathological swap-storm can't loop forever.
//
// This module is agent-loop-free (it lives in the sandbox leaf). It depends ONLY
// on injected closures (`readPointer` + `resolveActiveBackend`), so the API
// (`withChannelA`) and the worker (`resumeBoxForTurn`/the turn) wire it to the
// real `readActiveSandbox` DAO + a backend resolver without coupling the leaf to
// `@opengeni/db`.
