# @opengeni/sdk

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- a78a09b: Publish the SDK source that adds `OpenGeniClient.getClientConfig()` (returns `ClientConfig`). The method was added to the source but never republished, while `@opengeni/react@0.3.0` already depends on it — so react@0.3.0 consumers could not typecheck against the published sdk@0.2.0. Released as a patch so it stays within react@0.3.0's `^0.2.0` range.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 21c1535: Initial public release of the OpenGeni client packages.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: shared zod wire-contract schemas and types.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: zero-dependency, framework-agnostic TypeScript client with typed API, session lifecycle, and SSE streaming (reconnect + replay-by-sequence).
  - `@opengeni/react`: React hooks and styled components built on `@opengeni/sdk`.

  All three now ship ESM + `.d.ts` builds via tsup and are published to npm with provenance.
