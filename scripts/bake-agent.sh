# bake-agent.sh — compile, sign, and stage the per-SHA opengeni-agent binaries the
# API image serves from /agent/* (the "agent ships inside the control-plane"
# decision; dossier §23.x agent-distribution).
#
# Run this as a CI STEP in the deployed-env API image build (release.yml here, and
# the ops-repo per-SHA preview/staging/prod image builds) BEFORE `docker build`.
# It builds the two static Linux musl binaries that match THIS exact control-plane
# SHA, signs + checksums each, and writes them into agent/install/baked/ so they
# ride into the image via the Dockerfile's existing `COPY . .`.
#
# WHY a pre-build CI step (not the Dockerfile): the minisign signing key
# (OPENGENI_AGENT_MINISIGN_KEY) must never enter the Docker build layers. Signing
# here keeps the key in the CI step's masked env only; the build context receives
# already-signed, public artifacts.
#
#   OPENGENI_AGENT_MINISIGN_KEY   the minisign secret key body (same key the
#                                 install scripts pin). REQUIRED to sign. When
#                                 ABSENT the script still builds + checksums but
#                                 SKIPS signing and exits non-zero unless
#                                 OGE_BAKE_ALLOW_UNSIGNED=1 (so a key-less build
#                                 fails loud rather than baking an unverifiable
#                                 binary). An un-baked asset just falls through to
#                                 the GitHub-Releases redirect at serve time.
#   OGE_BAKE_TARGETS              space-separated cargo target triples to bake.
#                                 Default: the two Linux musl triples install.sh
#                                 resolves for Linux x86_64/aarch64.
#   OGE_BAKE_ALLOW_UNSIGNED=1     permit a checksum-only (unsigned) bake.
#
# Mirrors agent-release.yml's Linux build: static musl via cargo-zigbuild, signed
# with rsign2 (pure-Rust minisign). Both tools are pure-Rust so the runner needs no

# --- Toolchain: cargo-zigbuild gives a robust static musl cross-link with no

# `ziglang` pip wheel, which is NOT part of the cargo cache. Gating the wheel
# install on the binary's absence (the old behaviour) therefore SKIPPED zig on
