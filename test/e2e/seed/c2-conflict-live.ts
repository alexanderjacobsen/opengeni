// M8 C2 live reproduction — the wake-on-edit conflict guard, exercised against a
// REAL warm docker box. Mirrors `useWorkspaceEdit`'s base guard
// (use-workspace-edit.ts:150-158): before flushing a buffer it re-reads the live
// file and, if the live content diverged from the captured base, surfaces a
// conflict and writes NOTHING. Here we prove the underlying real-box condition:
//   1. seed a file with a known base via a turn (baked into the box snapshot),
//   2. warm the box + read the base (what the editor loaded from capture),
//   3. mutate the file out-of-band on the box (a second writer / the agent),
//   4. re-read live (the guard's exact check) → it diverged from base,
//   5. assert the guard would withhold the write → confirm no overwrite happened.
