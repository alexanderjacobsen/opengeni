// seed-live — STUB (dossier §16). A long-running / mid-turn session that stays
// WARM, for the warm-live UI path (live reads, live writes, fs.changed reconcile,
// machine chip = "live"; acceptance A3). Wired at M3 when the capture-vs-live
// source selection exists and the warm no-flicker reconcile is under test. Unlike
// the other seeds this must keep the box warm (hold a viewer / keep a turn
// running), not settle-and-drain.

const PLAN = `
Start a session whose turn kicks off a long-running process (or leave a turn
in-flight) so the box stays warm and reachable. The UI then exercises the live
path: live gitDiff/fsRead, an optimistic fs.write echo, and the machine chip
showing "live". Pair with a viewer-attach hold so the box does not drain during
the screenshot pass.
